# Growth Story Collections — Implementation Plan

_Last updated: 2024-07-26_

---

## 1. Overview

**Growth Story Collections** is a key differentiator for Magical Stories, providing **guided, themed, AI-personalized story bundles** focused on child development areas such as emotional intelligence, confidence, and social responsibility. It combines personalized AI story generation with progress tracking and gamification to foster positive growth in children.

---

## 2. Goals

- Enable parents to generate **collections** of stories tailored to their child's age, interests, and developmental focus.
- Present collections in a dedicated UI with **progress indicators** and **achievement badges**.
- Integrate seamlessly with existing story generation, storage, and reading flows.
- Support future monetization (e.g., premium collections) via StoreKit.

---

## 3. Dependencies

- **Designs**: Already completed.
- **Architecture**: MVVM with SwiftUI, Repository pattern, async/await, environment-based dependency injection.
- **Core SwiftData Models**: Base models like `Story` and `Page` are defined.

---

## 4. High-Level Architecture

- **Models**: `StoryCollection`, `Story`, `Page`
- **Repositories**: `CollectionRepository`, `StoryRepository`
- **Services**: `CollectionService` (new), `StoryService` (existing)
- **Views**: `CollectionsView`, `CollectionDetailView`, `CollectionFormView`
- **State Management**: `@StateObject` for services, injected via `.environmentObject`
- **Persistence**: SwiftData via repositories
- **AI Integration**: Use existing AI services to generate multiple stories per collection
- **Progress Tracking**: Via completion flags in models, achievements system

---

## 5. Implementation Phases & Steps

### Phase 4.1: Models & Service Layer

- **5.1.1 Define `StoryCollection` Model**
  - Attributes: `id`, `title`, `theme`, `ageGroup`, `focusArea`, `createdDate`, `stories: [Story]`, `progress`, `achievements`
  - Use `@Model` with SwiftData annotations
- **5.1.2 Implement `CollectionRepository`**
  - CRUD operations for collections
  - Fetch collections with filtering/sorting
  - Manage relationships with `Story` entities
- **5.1.3 Implement `CollectionService`**
  - Business logic for:
    - Creating a new collection (invokes AI to generate multiple stories)
    - Fetching collections
    - Updating progress
    - Awarding achievements
  - Use async/await for AI calls and persistence
- **5.1.4 Integrate with `StoryService`**
  - Reuse story generation logic for each story in a collection
  - Batch AI calls with error handling and retries

---

### Phase 4.2: UI Implementation

- **5.2.1 Create `CollectionFormView`**
  - Input: Child's age group, developmental focus, interests
  - Triggers collection generation via `CollectionService`
- **5.2.2 Create `CollectionsView`**
  - List of all collections with progress indicators
  - Accessed via Home tab or dedicated Collections tab
- **5.2.3 Create `CollectionDetailView`**
  - Displays stories within a collection
  - Shows progress, achievements, and allows reading stories
- **5.2.4 UI Integration**
  - Add navigation from Home and/or Library to Collections
  - Use SwiftUI navigation patterns (`NavigationStack`, `.sheet`, `.navigationDestination`)
  - Display gamification elements (badges, animations)

---

### Phase 4.3: Integration & Progress Tracking

- **5.3.1 Connect UI to `CollectionService`**
  - Bind views to service data using `@EnvironmentObject`
- **5.3.2 Implement Progress Tracking**
  - Track completed stories within a collection
  - Update progress and unlock achievements
- **5.3.3 Integrate with Achievements System**
  - Award badges based on milestones (e.g., completing a collection)
- **5.3.4 Prepare for StoreKit Integration**
  - Mark premium collections for future monetization
  - Hide behind feature flags or placeholders if StoreKit not yet ready

---

### Phase 4.4: Testing

- **5.4.1 Unit Tests**
  - `CollectionService` logic (creation, fetching, progress updates)
  - `CollectionRepository` CRUD operations
- **5.4.2 Integration Tests**
  - End-to-end flow: form input → AI generation → persistence → UI display
- **5.4.3 UI Tests**
  - Collection creation, browsing, reading, progress updates
- **5.4.4 Mocking**
  - Use protocol-based mocks for AI services and repositories
- **5.4.5 TDD Approach**
  - Write failing tests first, then implement minimal code to pass
  - Refactor with tests green
