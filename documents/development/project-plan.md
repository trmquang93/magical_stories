-   [ ] **Phase 5: StoreKit Integration** (Implement Design) - 📅 **Planned**
-   [ ] **Phase 6: UI Polish & Advanced Features** - 📅 **Planned**

### Phase Details

#### Phase 1: Core MVP (Completed)
-   Implemented core services (`StoryService`, basic `PersistenceService` with UserDefaults, basic `SettingsService`).
-   Integrated Google AI for text generation.
-   Established basic SwiftUI structure (`TabView`, `NavigationStack`).
-   Implemented core UI views (`HomeView`, `StoryFormView`, basic `LibraryView`, `StoryDetailView`, `PageView`, `SettingsView`).
-   Initial implementation of `IllustrationService` and `StoryProcessor` for image generation and pagination.

#### Phase 2: API & Testing Refinement (Completed)
-   Verified Google AI Image Generation integration (`gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation` model, API key, response parsing).
-   Implemented robust mocking strategies (protocol-based) for services (`IllustrationServiceProtocol`, etc.).
-   Migrated relevant unit/integration tests to Swift Testing framework.
-   Improved overall test coverage and added integration tests.
-   Refined error handling (`AIErrorManager`).

#### Phase 3: SwiftData Migration (Planned - Next)
-   **Goal:** Replace `UserDefaults` persistence with SwiftData for core data models.
-   **Reference:** `documents/data/persistence-guide.md`, `documents/data/swift-data-schema.md`
-   **Sub-Phases:**
    1.  **Schema & Repository Implementation:** Define final `@Model` classes (`Story`, `Page`, `StoryCollection`, etc.) based on the schema doc. Implement corresponding Repositories (`StoryRepository`, `CollectionRepository`).
    2.  **Service Integration:** Update services (`StoryService`, `CollectionService`, etc.) to use Repositories instead of the legacy `PersistenceService`.
    3.  **Data Migration:** Implement and test the one-time migration logic from `UserDefaults` to SwiftData (as outlined in `persistence-guide.md`).
    4.  **Testing:** Ensure all persistence-related tests pass using an in-memory SwiftData store or mock repositories. Test the migration thoroughly.

#### Phase 4: Growth Collections (Planned)
-   **Goal:** Implement the "Growth Collections" feature based on the completed design.
-   **Reference:** `memory_bank/productContext.md`, `memory_bank/systemPatterns.md`
-   **Sub-Phases:**
    1.  **Models & Service:** Implement `StoryCollection` model (if not done in Phase 3) and `CollectionService` logic for creating, fetching, and managing collections.
    2.  **UI Implementation:** Build UI views for browsing, viewing, and potentially creating/managing collections.
    3.  **Integration:** Connect UI to `CollectionService` and ensure data flows correctly. Integrate with potential achievement/progress tracking.
    4.  **Testing:** Unit and integration tests for `CollectionService` and UI tests for the feature flow.

#### Phase 5: StoreKit Integration (Planned)
-   **Goal:** Implement monetization using StoreKit 2 based on the architectural design.
-   **Reference:** `documents/api/storekit-integration.md`
-   **Sub-Phases (as per design doc):**
    1.  **Core Setup & Purchase Flow:** Implement `PurchaseService`, `EntitlementManager` (basic), `PaywallView`, define products, set up StoreKit config file.
    2.  **Entitlement & Feature Gating:** Refine `EntitlementManager`, implement Restore Purchases, integrate checks into UI.
    3.  **Advanced & Edge Cases:** Manage Subscriptions link, handle edge cases, potential server validation, UI polish.
    4.  **Testing:** Thorough testing using StoreKit configuration, mock services, and potentially Sandbox environment.

#### Phase 6: UI Polish & Advanced Features (Planned)
-   Refine UI animations, transitions, and overall aesthetics.
-   Address remaining UX improvements.
-   Implement any lower-priority features (e.g., advanced parental controls, enhanced accessibility).
-   Performance optimization and final testing rounds.

1.  Implement SwiftData `@Model` classes based on `swift-data-schema.md`.
2.  Implement core Repositories (`StoryRepository`, etc.) interacting with SwiftData `ModelContext`.
3.  Begin integrating Repositories into relevant services, replacing `PersistenceService` usage.
4.  Develop and test the `UserDefaults` to SwiftData migration logic (`MigrationManager`).
5.  Plan Sprint tasks for completing Phase 3.

### Planning Horizon
-   Sprint Duration: 1-2 weeks (TBD)
-   Next Review: TBD
-   Major Milestone: SwiftData Migration Complete
