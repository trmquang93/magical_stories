# Growth Path Collections: Feature Overview & Development Plan

## Feature Purpose
Growth Path Collections provide themed, developmentally-focused sets of stories. Each collection targets a specific growth area (e.g., Emotional Intelligence, Problem Solving) and tracks progress as stories are read and completed. The feature guides children through structured content, with progress tracking and (planned) achievements.

## User Flow
1. **Access Collections:** User taps "Collections" tab to view all collections.
2. **Browse Collections:** User sees a list of collection cards with progress indicators.
3. **View Collection Details:** User taps a card to see stories and progress within the collection.
4. **Read a Story:** User selects a story, reads it, and upon completion, progress is updated.
5. **Track Progress:** Collection and story progress are updated and reflected in the UI.
6. **Create New Collection:** User initiates creation, fills out the form, and a new collection with stories is generated.
7. **Ongoing Engagement:** User continues reading, tracking progress, and earning (future) achievements.

## Integration Points
- **Models:** `StoryCollection`, `GrowthCategory`, `StoryModel` (with `readCount`, `lastReadAt`, `isCompleted`)
- **Services:** `CollectionService`, `CollectionRepository`, `StoryService`
- **UI:** `CollectionsListView`, `CollectionCardView`, `CollectionDetailView`, `CollectionFormView`, `StoryDetailView`
- **Persistence:** SwiftData via repositories
- **Progress Tracking:** Implemented and tested (story completion updates collection progress)
- **Testing:** Unit and integration tests exist for core flows

- Ensure accessibility (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)
- Add animations or feedback for progress/achievements (if feasible)
- Haptic feedback and visual refinement

### T9: Documentation & Memory Bank Update

## Improvement Options
- Enhance search/filter in collections list
- Enable editing or deleting collections
- Add more granular progress tracking (per page, per session)
- Add parental insights/reporting on growth areas
- Extract reusable loading/error overlay component for forms

## [2025-04-16] Navigation Update
- Growth Collections are now accessible via a dedicated "Collections" tab in the main navigation (MainTabView).
- CollectionsListView is the entry point for browsing and managing collections.
- This enables direct UI testing and supports incremental feature development.
