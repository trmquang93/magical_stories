# Project Progress: Magical Stories (as of 2025-04-06)

## What Works / Implemented Features

-   **Core App Structure:** Basic SwiftUI app structure with `TabView` navigation (Home, Library, Settings) is in place.
-   **Story Generation:**
    -   UI (`StoryFormView`) exists for inputting parameters.
    -   `StoryService` structured for AI integration (placeholder API call) to generate story content based on parameters.
-   **Story Library:**
    -   `LibraryView` displays saved stories.
    -   Stories are persisted locally using `UserDefaults` (MVP).
-   **Story Reading:**
    -   `StoryDetailView` displays story content, paginated using `TabView`.
    -   Page indicator and progress bar are functional.
-   **Settings:**
    -   `SettingsView` allows configuration of app settings and parental controls.
    -   `SettingsService` manages and persists these settings using `UserDefaults`.
-   **Parental Controls:** Basic controls for content filtering (theme, age) and screen time (max stories per day) are implemented in `SettingsService`.
-   **Testing:** Unit tests (using Swift Testing) and UI tests (using XCTest) exist for various components. A test script (`run_tests.sh`) is available. Build errors and test failures resolved; all tests passing.
-   **Core Models:** Standardized core data models (`Story`, `StoryParameters`).
-   **Persistence:** Integrated `PersistenceService` (`UserDefaults`) into `StoryService`.

## What's Left / Next Steps

-   **Illustration Generation:** Currently not implemented. Requires selecting an image generation AI and integrating it, likely into `StoryService` or a dedicated `IllustrationService`.
-   **Growth Story Collections:** UI (`GrowthStoryFormView`) might exist, but the logic for generating themed collections based on developmental goals needs implementation.
-   **StoreKit Integration:** Configured but likely not fully implemented for premium features or subscriptions.
-   **UI Polishing:** Further refinement of UI elements, animations, and overall user experience.
-   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling exists, but may need more robust implementation across different scenarios (e.g., network errors during AI calls, persistence errors).
-   **Accessibility:** Basic guidelines exist, but thorough accessibility testing and implementation (e.g., VoiceOver support for dynamic content) are likely needed.
-   **CI/CD:** Basic configuration mentioned, may need further setup and refinement.
