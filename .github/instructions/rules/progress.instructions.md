# Project Progress Status

## Recently Completed (Current Session)
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved subscription status update bug after purchase
  - **Issue**: SubscriptionCard not updating after successful purchase (required app restart)
  - **Root Cause**: TransactionObserver not receiving transactions; PurchaseService verified but didn't finish transactions
  - **Solution**: Modified PurchaseService to directly update EntitlementManager after verification and finish transactions
  - **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED WORKING - subscription status now updates immediately

## Core Platform Status
- **SwiftUI Architecture**: ✅ Stable
- **SwiftData Integration**: ✅ Working (with CoreData warnings - non-blocking)
- **StoreKit 2 IAP**: ✅ FIXED - Full purchase flow working
- **Google AI Integration**: ✅ Stable (Gemini 2.5-flash-preview + 1.5-pro)
- **Illustration Services**: ✅ Stable

## Known Issues
- CoreData Array materialization warnings (non-blocking, legacy data compatibility)
- Some test files disabled (.disabled extension) - test suite needs cleanup
- Switch exhaustiveness warnings in StoreKit error handling

## Recent Architecture Improvements  
- Enhanced transaction logging system for debugging
- Direct EntitlementManager updates in PurchaseService
- Improved error handling in subscription flow
- Transaction finishing to prevent duplicate processing

## Testing Status
- IAP functionality: ✅ Verified working in fresh install scenario
- UI reactive updates: ✅ Working correctly
- Subscription persistence: ✅ Working correctly
- Error handling: ✅ Robust

## Next Priorities
1. Clean up disabled test files
2. Address CoreData Array warnings (low priority)
3. Continue feature development on stable foundation
