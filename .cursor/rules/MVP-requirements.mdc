**Primary Objectives:**  
- Validate that parents and children enjoy personalized, AI‑generated bedtime stories.
- Establish a core revenue model (freemium/subscription or select in‑app purchases) without overcomplicating the product.
- Keep development lean and focused on the core storytelling functionality.

**Core MVP Features:**
- **User Input:**  
  - Simple forms for parents to enter the child’s name, age, favorite animal/cartoon character, and select a moral/theme (e.g., friendship, bravery).
- **Story Generation:**  
  - Construct a prompt from user inputs.
  - Call a cloud-based AI service (e.g., Google AI API or similar) to generate a story.
- **Story Display:**  
  - Show the generated text in a clean, child‑friendly reading interface.
- **Basic Personalization:**  
  - Integrate simple customization such as font size, night mode, and a read‑aloud (TTS) option.
- **Story Library (Optional for MVP):**  
  - Allow users to save and review previous stories (stored locally on the device or using a lightweight cloud service).
- **Parental Controls:**  
  - Include basic settings that let parents filter content (even if only through preset “kid-friendly” guidelines passed in the prompt).

*This focused feature set ensures you’re building the “must-have” without extra bells and whistles.*
