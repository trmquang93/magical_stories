# Project Progress: Magical Stories (as of 2025-05-18)

## Recent Updates

### 2025-05-18
- **Visual Consistency System Debugging Enhancement:** Added comprehensive debug logging to the illustration generation system:
  - Added debug logs to `PromptBuilder` for tracking global reference and sequential illustration prompt creation
  - Added task type and dependency information to `IllustrationTaskManager` logs
  - Enhanced `IllustrationService` with detailed logging for each generation step
  - Implemented circular dependency detection and resolution logging
  - Added task queue statistics and processing status logging
  - These logs provide complete visibility into the blueprint image generation, dependency management, and sequential illustration creation process

### 2025-05-16
- **Visual Consistency System and Task Dependency Management:** Added a comprehensive system to ensure consistent character appearance across story illustrations and implemented task dependency handling:
  - Created new `VisualGuide` model with style guide, character definitions, and setting definitions properties
  - Enhanced XML structure in story generation to include a detailed `<visual_guide>` section
  - Updated `IllustrationTask` model with dependency tracking and reference properties
  - Implemented `IllustrationTaskManager` with dependency handling to ensure sequential task processing
  - Enhanced `PromptBuilder` with methods for global reference images and sequential illustrations
  - Implemented circular dependency detection and resolution to prevent processing deadlocks
  - Added extensive test suite including `VisualGuideTests` and `IllustrationConsistencyIntegrationTests`

### 2025-05-01
- **CollectionService Testing Completed:** Implemented comprehensive unit tests and integration tests for the Growth Collections feature with over 85% test coverage.

### 2025-04-23
- **Navigation Fix for AllStoriesView:** Fixed an issue where tapping the back button in StoryDetailView when accessed from AllStoriesView would incorrectly navigate back to LibraryView (root).
- **Story Model & Service Enhancements:** Added support for category-based filtering, developmental focus, and emotional themes in story generation.

### 2025-04-20
- **Story Service Enhancement:** Updated `StoryParameters` model and `StoryService` to incorporate optional parameters for generating richer, more developmentally beneficial stories.

## Core Implemented Features

-   **Story Generation:** AI-powered generation of personalized children's stories with adjustable parameters including age, theme, developmental focus, and emotional themes.

-   **Story Library:** Category-based browsing and search of saved stories with SwiftData persistence.

-   **Story Reading:** Paginated reading experience with illustrations.

-   **Settings & Parental Controls:** Content filtering by theme/age and usage limits.

-   **Growth Collections:** Themed story sets focused on developmental areas with progress tracking and achievements.

-   **Visual Consistency System:**
    * **Blueprint-First Approach:** Generates global reference image with all characters before page illustrations
    * **Dependency Management:** Ensures page illustrations are created in correct sequence
    * **Character Consistency:** Maintains consistent character appearance across all story illustrations
    * **Debugging:** Comprehensive logging of the generation process and task dependencies
    * **Key Components:**
        1. `VisualGuide` model stores style, character, and setting information
        2. `IllustrationTaskType` defines task types (globalReference, pageIllustration)
        3. `IllustrationTaskManager` handles dependencies and sequential processing
        4. `PromptBuilder` generates specialized prompts with visual references
    * **Process Flow:**
        1. Extract visual guide information from story XML
        2. Create global reference image containing all characters first
        3. Create page illustrations with dependencies on global reference
        4. Process tasks in dependency-aware order
        5. Include references to previous images in prompts
        6. Detect and resolve circular dependencies automatically

-   **Technical Infrastructure:**
    * SwiftUI-based UI with TabView navigation
    * SwiftData persistence through Repository pattern
    * Protocol-based testing with 85%+ coverage
    * Google AI integration for text (SDK) and images (REST API)

## Current Development Focus

**Visual Consistency System Debugging and Monitoring (In Progress - 2025-05-18)**
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the illustration generation pipeline
- Created a consistent logging format with component prefixes for easier tracking
- Implemented detailed reporting of task dependencies and processing status
- Added support for displaying character consistency information during generation
- Currently working on refinement and documentation updates

## Next Steps

**Visual Consistency System Plan**
| Step | Task                               | Status         |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| VC1  | Core Model Implementation          | ✓ Completed    |
| VC2  | Service Integration                | ✓ Completed    |
| VC3  | Testing Implementation             | ✓ Completed    |
| VC4  | Documentation & Debugging          | In Progress    |
| VC5  | UI Visual Feedback                 | Pending        |

**Final Polish**
- UI/UX refinement for collection views and progress indicators
- Accessibility improvements (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)
- Documentation updates for new features
- Continued test coverage improvements

## Future Priorities

- **StoreKit Integration:** Implement monetization strategy using StoreKit 2
- **Enhanced UI Animations:** Add polish to story and collection transitions
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Comprehensive VoiceOver and Dynamic Type support
- **Visual Consistency UI Indicators:** Show users when illustrations maintain character consistency
- **Expanded Testing Suite:** Continue pushing toward 90%+ test coverage
- **Performance Optimization:** Ensure smooth operation on older devices
- **CI/CD Enhancements:** Streamline build and deploy processes
