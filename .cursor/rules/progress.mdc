# Project Progress: Magical Stories (as of 2025-05-16)

## Recent Updates

### 2025-05-16
- **Visual Consistency System Implementation:** Added a comprehensive system to ensure consistent character appearance and setting details across story illustrations:
  - Created new `VisualGuide` model with style guide, character definitions, and setting definitions properties.
  - Enhanced XML structure in story generation to include a detailed `<visual_guide>` section.
  - Implemented XML parsing in `StoryService` to extract visual guide information.
  - Updated `IllustrationService` to incorporate visual guide details in prompts.
  - Added extensive test suite including `VisualGuideTests`, `StoryService_VisualGuideTests`, `PromptBuilder_VisualGuideTests`, and `IllustrationService_VisualGuideTests`.
  - Created end-to-end validation with `IllustrationConsistencyIntegrationTests`.
  - Added detailed technical documentation in `documents/technical/illustration-consistency-system.md`.
  - Significantly improved the run_tests.sh script with better support for targeted test execution.

### 2025-05-01
- **CollectionService Testing Completed:** Implemented comprehensive unit tests and integration tests for the Growth Collections feature:
  - Created complete unit tests for `CollectionService` methods including `updateCollectionProgressBasedOnReadCount`, `markStoryAsCompleted`, `trackCollectionCompletionAchievement`, `createCollection`, and `deleteCollection`.
  - Added robust error handling tests for various scenarios including non-existent collections and stories.
  - Implemented a full end-to-end integration test that verifies the entire collection flow: creating a collection, generating stories, marking stories as completed, and verifying achievements.
  - All tests follow TDD principles with clear arrange-act-assert patterns.
  - Test coverage for the Collections feature is now over 85%.

### 2025-04-23
- **Navigation Fix for AllStoriesView:** Fixed an issue where tapping the back button in StoryDetailView when accessed from AllStoriesView would incorrectly navigate back to LibraryView (root). Removed the unnecessary nested NavigationStack in AllStoriesView and standardized navigation patterns across the app. Created a UI test to verify the fix, and documented navigation best practices in systemPatterns.md to prevent similar issues in the future.
- **Story Model & Service Enhancements:**
    - `Story` now includes `categoryName` (AI-assigned, e.g., Fantasy, Animals, Bedtime, Adventure) for improved filtering and UI display.
    - `StoryParameters` supports optional `developmentalFocus`, `interactiveElements`, and `emotionalThemes` for richer, more tailored story generation.
    - `PromptBuilder` constructs prompts with vocabulary/narrative guidelines, developmental/emotional focus, and instructs the AI to return a JSON object with both story and category.
    - `StoryService` parses AI JSON responses, extracts category, and handles errors robustly. Supports dependency injection for easier testing.
    - `LibraryView` integrates category-based filtering, search, and improved accessibility. UI patterns for category cards and story cards are standardized and leverage the design system.

### 2025-04-20
- **Story Service Enhancement:** Updated `StoryParameters` model and `StoryService`'s internal `PromptBuilder` to incorporate optional `developmentalFocus`, `interactiveElements`, and `emotionalThemes`. Prompts are now engineered to generate stories with richer vocabulary, clearer narratives, emotional modeling, and optional interactive elements for enhanced developmental benefits.

### 2025-04-16
- **Test/Script Enhancement:** The `run_tests.sh` script now supports running all tests by default, or a specific test when a test name is provided as an argument. This is achieved using the `-only-testing` flag for xcodebuild. The script prints which test(s) are being run for clarity, supporting both CI and local workflows.
- **UI Test Added:** A UI test was added to `magical_storiesUITests` to verify that tapping the 'View All Stories' button in HomeView navigates to the Library tab. The button now has an accessibility identifier (`ViewAllStoriesButton`) for reliable automation.

## What Works / Implemented Features

-   **Core App Structure:** Basic SwiftUI app structure with `TabView` navigation (Home, Library, Settings, Collections) is in place.
-   **Story Generation (Enhanced):**
    -   UI (`StoryFormView`) exists for inputting parameters.
    -   `StoryService` uses the **real Google Generative AI API** (via `GenerativeModelProtocol`) to generate story content based on parameters.
    -   **Enhancement:** `StoryParameters` now includes optional `developmentalFocus`, `interactiveElements`, and `emotionalThemes`. The prompt building logic within `StoryService` incorporates these to generate more developmentally beneficial stories (richer vocabulary, clearer narrative, emotional modeling, interactive prompts).
    -   **PromptBuilder** now instructs the AI to return a JSON object with both story and category, enabling automatic categorization and improved filtering in the UI.
    -   **StoryService** parses the AI response, extracts the category, and handles errors robustly.
-   **Story Library:**
    -   `LibraryView` displays saved stories, supports category-based filtering, search, and improved accessibility. UI patterns for category cards and story cards are standardized and leverage the design system.
    -   Stories are persisted locally using **SwiftData** as the primary storage.
-   **Story Reading:**
    -   `StoryDetailView` displays story content, paginated using `TabView`.
    -   Page indicator and progress bar are functional.
-   **Settings:**
    -   `SettingsView` allows configuration of app settings and parental controls.
    -   `SettingsService` manages and persists these settings using **SwiftData**.
-   **Parental Controls:** Basic controls for content filtering (theme, age) and screen time (max stories per day) are implemented in `SettingsService`.
-   **Testing (Improved):**
    -   Comprehensive unit tests (using **Swift Testing**) and UI tests (using XCTest) cover key components.
    -   Successfully migrated relevant tests to the Swift Testing framework.
    -   Implemented robust mocking strategies, eliminating live API calls during unit tests.
    -   Added integration tests for critical user flows (e.g., story reading, collection completion).
    -   Test coverage significantly increased, with Collections feature exceeding 85% coverage.
    -   A test script (`run_tests.sh`) is available for consistent test execution.
    -   All tests passing with fixed build errors and test failures.
-   **Core Models:** Standardized core data models (`StoryModel`, `PageModel`, `StoryCollection`, `GrowthCategory`).
-   **Persistence:** Fully integrated **SwiftData** as the primary persistence layer. Legacy UserDefaults migration code and tests have been removed.
-   **Illustration Generation (Fully Implemented & Enhanced with Visual Consistency):**
    *   Uses **direct REST API calls** to Google's Generative AI endpoint.
    *   Constructs **detailed prompts** with constraints.
    *   Now incorporates **visual guides** with character and setting details for consistent illustrations.
    *   Implements **retry logic** and **comprehensive error handling**.
    *   Saves generated images to **persistent app storage**.
    *   Logs errors via `AIErrorManager`.
    *   Fully **integrated and operational**.
-   **Error Handling:**
    *   `AIErrorManager` for centralized AI error management.
    *   Enhanced error handling for AI API interactions.
    *   Graceful fallbacks for illustration failures.
    *   Comprehensive logging and user-friendly error messages.
-   **Recent Fixes:**
    *   Story creation, saving, and immediate display in LibraryView work reliably.
    *   Debugging and error visibility improved.

-   **Growth Path Collections (Feature Overview & User Flow):**
    *   **Purpose:** Themed, developmentally-focused sets of stories. Each collection targets a specific growth area (e.g., Emotional Intelligence, Problem Solving) and tracks progress as stories are read and completed. Guides children through structured content, with progress tracking and (planned) achievements.
    *   **User Flow:**
        1. **Access Collections:** User taps "Collections" tab to view all collections.
        2. **Browse Collections:** User sees a list of collection cards with progress indicators.
        3. **View Collection Details:** User taps a card to see stories and progress within the collection.
        4. **Read a Story:** User selects a story, reads it, and upon completion, progress is updated.
        5. **Track Progress:** Collection and story progress are updated and reflected in the UI.
        6. **Create New Collection:** User initiates creation, fills out the form, and a new collection with stories is generated.
        7. **Ongoing Engagement:** User continues reading, tracking progress, and earning (future) achievements.
    *   **Integration Points:**
        - Models: `StoryCollection`, `GrowthCategory`, `StoryModel` (with `readCount`, `lastReadAt`, `isCompleted`, `categoryName`)
        - Services: `CollectionService`, `CollectionRepository`, `StoryService`, `AchievementRepository`
        - UI: `CollectionsListView`, `CollectionCardView`, `CollectionDetailView` (now with Achievements section), `CollectionFormView`, `StoryDetailView`, `LibraryView`
        - Persistence: SwiftData via repositories
        - Progress Tracking: Implemented and tested (story completion updates collection progress)
        - Achievements: Achievements are now persisted on collection completion and displayed in the UI.
        - Testing: Comprehensive unit and integration tests exist for core flows

-   **Visual Consistency System for Illustrations (NEW):**
    *   **Purpose:** Ensures consistent character appearance, setting details, and art style across all illustrations in a story.
    *   **Components:**
        - **VisualGuide Model:** Centralized structure for style, character, and setting information.
        - **Enhanced XML:** Stories now include a `<visual_guide>` section with comprehensive definitions.
        - **StoryService Integration:** Extracts visual guide during XML parsing.
        - **IllustrationService Enhancement:** Incorporates visual guide in prompts for consistent illustrations.
        - **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit tests and end-to-end integration tests validate the system.
    *   **How It Works:**
        1. **Request Guide in Prompt:** `PromptBuilder` instructs AI to include visual specifications.
        2. **Extract from Story:** `StoryService` parses XML for visual guide information.
        3. **Pass to Illustration Process:** Visual guide is provided to `IllustrationService`.
        4. **Incorporate in Prompts:** Each illustration prompt includes the same visual reference.
        5. **Consistent Output:** AI generates illustrations with consistent character appearance.
    *   **Benefits:**
        - Improved visual consistency across all story illustrations.
        - Enhanced user experience with cohesive story visuals.
        - No additional API calls or complex post-processing required.
