## TDD Workflow MUST be followed
- Only implement code after tests are defined and verified to fail (red phase).
- Focus on making tests pass with minimal, incremental code changes (green phase).
- Refactor code as needed while ensuring all tests continue to pass (refactor phase).
- Do not implement untested functionality.

## Protocols
- Before coding, confirm that:
  - Tests exist for the required functionality.
  - Tests fail as expected before implementation.
- After implementation, ensure:
  - All relevant tests pass.
  - No untested code is introduced.
  - Run tests after each code change to verify the change makes tests pass.
- Refactor only with a passing test suite.
- Follow the reporting protocol and format specified by the Manager in the subtask instructions.

## Notes
- Do not define your own reporting or communication protocol; always follow the Manager's instructions.
- Prioritize TDD discipline and incremental, test-driven development.
