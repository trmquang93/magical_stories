# Issue Fixing Protocol
When addressing an issue, bug, or crash, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Test:** 
   - Write a test that verifies the issue is reproducible. This test should cover the specific scenario where the bug occurs.

2. **Run the Test:**
   - Ensure that the test fails, confirming that the issue is valid and reproducible.
3. **Fix the Problem:**
   - Once you have a failing test, proceed to implement the fix for the issue.

4. **Verify the Fix:**
   - After applying the fix, run the test suite again to ensure that the test now passes and that no other tests are broken.

5. **Document the Change:**
   - Update any relevant documentation or comments to reflect the changes made and the resolution of the issue.
