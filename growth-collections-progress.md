## Key Achievements

1. Successfully enhanced all three main collection-related views with modern UI patterns, animations, and improved UX.
2. Implemented comprehensive UI tests covering the core user journeys.
3. Created reusable UI components (ValidatedTextField, empty state views) that can be leveraged elsewhere in the app.
4. Improved overall app navigation with the TabSelection model.
5. Added haptic feedback for a more engaging physical experience.

## Next Steps

1. Resume and complete the testing tasks when environment issues are resolved.
2. Proceed with documentation and analytics implementation.
3. Conduct final QA testing and sign-off.
4. Update relevant project documentation with implementation details.

## Notes

Some testing tasks encountered environment issues that prevented their completion. These will need to be addressed before proceeding with Phase 4. The UI enhancements have been successfully implemented and verified through manual testing, providing a solid foundation for the remaining work.
