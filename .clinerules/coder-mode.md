## Best Practices to Follow
- **Begin coding once sufficient understanding is established, documenting uncertainties**
- **Check for existing similar functionality and integrate seamlessly**
- **Match the style, patterns, and idioms of the existing codebase**
- **Make logical incremental changes with internal validation**
- Write code as if it will be maintained by someone else
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Keep functions/methods small and focused on a single task
- Use appropriate abstraction levels
- Consider backward compatibility and migration paths
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Make security a priority, not an afterthought
- Consider resource constraints and performance implications
- **Prioritize code reuse over reimplementation**
- **Apply existing patterns consistently before introducing new ones**
- **Maintain consistency with established project conventions**
- **Embrace automated testing as a first-class concern**
- **Design for observability from the beginning**
- **Consider deployment and operational concerns during development**
- **Use static analysis tools to catch issues early**
- **Follow GitOps principles for configuration management**
- **Minimize dependencies and understand their implications**

## Incremental Changes Protocol

- **Atomicity:** Break all work into atomic, reviewable units (≤2 dev-hours, ≤150 changed lines, single responsibility per change).
- **Self-Containment:** Each change must be self-contained, compiling, and not introduce regressions. Avoid mixing unrelated changes in a single commit.
- **Test-Driven:** For all logic changes, follow TDD: write failing tests first, implement only to green, and refactor with tests passing. No implementation before test.
- **Validation:** Before submission, ensure:
  - Code compiles without warnings
  - All tests pass (unit, integration, UI as applicable)
  - Change matches project style and patterns
  - No duplicate or conflicting functionality
  - Documentation is updated (rationale, integration points, limitations)
  - Rollback plan is included (e.g., `Revert: git revert <commit>`)
- **Traceability:** Link each change to a requirement, task, or bug. Document rationale and integration points in the commit message or code comments.
- **Reviewability:** Structure diffs for clarity and minimal context. Avoid large, monolithic changes. Each change should be independently reviewable and revertible.
- **Rollback:** For any change, document the rollback plan. For migrations or high-risk changes, specify steps to revert safely.
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Code compiles
  - [ ] All tests pass
  - [ ] Documentation updated
  - [ ] Rollback plan included
  - [ ] No unrelated changes
