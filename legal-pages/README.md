# Legal Pages for Magical Stories

This directory contains the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pages for the Magical Stories iOS app, designed to be hosted on Firebase Hosting.

## üìã Contents

- `terms-of-use.html` - Comprehensive Terms of Use document
- `privacy-policy.html` - Detailed Privacy Policy with COPPA compliance  
- `index.html` - Landing page with links to legal documents
- `firebase.json` - Firebase Hosting configuration
- `.firebaserc` - Firebase project configuration

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login to Firebase: `firebase login`
3. Create a Firebase project (or use existing one)

### Initial Setup
1. Update `.firebaserc` with your Firebase project ID:
   ```json
   {
     "projects": {
       "default": "your-firebase-project-id"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Initialize Firebase Hosting (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cd legal-pages
   firebase init hosting
   ```

### Deploy to Firebase
```bash
cd legal-pages
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

Your legal pages will be available at:
- `https://your-project-id.web.app/`
- `https://your-project-id.firebaseapp.com/`

### Custom Domain (Optional)
You can set up a custom domain like `legal.magicalstories.app`:
1. Go to Firebase Console > Hosting
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the DNS configuration steps

## üîó URL Structure

The Firebase configuration provides clean URLs:
- `/` - Legal landing page
- `/terms` - Terms of Use (redirects to `terms-of-use.html`)
- `/privacy` - Privacy Policy (redirects to `privacy-policy.html`)
- `/legal` - Same as landing page

## üì± Integration with iOS App

Add these URLs to your iOS app's Settings:
```swift
// In your Settings view or constants file
struct LegalURLs {
    static let termsOfUse = "https://your-project-id.web.app/terms"
    static let privacyPolicy = "https://your-project-id.web.app/privacy"
}
```

Example SwiftUI implementation:
```swift
Link("Terms of Use", destination: URL(string: LegalURLs.termsOfUse)!)
Link("Privacy Policy", destination: URL(string: LegalURLs.privacyPolicy)!)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
