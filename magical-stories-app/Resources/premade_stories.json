It was Moonbeam Cat! He purred softly and rubbed against Luna's leg, then looked at the dim glow-worms with his wise, knowing eyes.\n\nMoonbeam Cat seemed to understand. He looked towards the edge of the garden, where the Whispering Woods began, then back at Luna, as if asking her to follow. Luna felt a flicker of nervousness, but Moonbeam Cat's glow felt safe. She knew he would show her what to do to help her tiny twinkling friends.",

Shadows danced, and the leaves seemed to whisper secrets high above.\n\nMoonbeam Cat padded ahead, his glowing fur lighting the path just enough for Luna to see. A friendly squirrel peeked down from a branch, chattering softly. Moonbeam Cat flicked his tail towards the squirrel, and it seemed to point further into the woods with its nose before scampering away. It felt like the woods themselves were helping them! Moonbeam Cat led Luna deeper, past glowing mushrooms and flowers that bloomed only in the moonlight.\n\nHe stopped near a place where the trees grew very close together, almost like a tangled wall. \"Mrow,\" he seemed to say, looking at a thick patch of bushes with pointy thorns. Right in the middle of the prickly bushes, Luna saw a faint, beautiful light. It was a flower, glowing softly like a tiny captured moon. Could that be what the glow-worms needed?",

Maybe these bushes needed kindness, too? Luna took another deep breath and spoke to the prickly thicket in a soft, gentle voice. \"Hello, lovely bushes. We need just a little bit of the glowing flower to help our friends. Could you please make a tiny space for us?\" As she spoke, the tangled branches seemed to rustle and part just a little, as if listening.
