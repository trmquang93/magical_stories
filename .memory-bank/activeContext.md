# Active Context: Magical Stories

## Current Work Focus
âœ… **COMPLETED:** Major prompting system refactoring using TDD methodology to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability.

âœ… **COMPLETED:** IAP (In-App Purchase) documentation organization and test case management
- All IAP-related documentation centralized in `documents/iap/` folder
- Fixed test case numbering conflicts in manual test cases
- Enhanced TransactionObserver testing coverage

âœ… **COMPLETED:** IAP Test Coverage Enhancement
- Re-enabled EntitlementManagerTests.swift with 9 comprehensive test methods
- Created PurchaseServiceTests.swift with 13 new test methods covering TC-004 to TC-007
- Fixed SubscriptionIntegrationTests.swift with proper service integration testing
- Resolved property access issues and mock service conflicts

**UPCOMING:** Phase 2 enhancements (Combine integration, actor coordination) and systematic re-enabling of remaining disabled test files.

## Recent Changes
- **ðŸ“‹ IAP Documentation & Testing Organization:**
  - **Centralized IAP Documentation:** All IAP-related documentation moved to `documents/iap/` folder
    - `IAP_MANUAL_TEST_CASES.md` - 31 comprehensive manual test cases (TC-001 to TC-031)
    - `IAP_TESTS_SUCCESS_REPORT.md` - Test execution results and validation
    - `IAP_UI_TESTS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - UI testing framework summary
    - `IAP_UI_TESTS_VERIFICATION.md` - UI test verification procedures
    - `IAP_UI_TEST_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` - Automation strategy and planning
    - `IAP_UI_TEST_DEMO.md` - Demo and example documentation
    - `PURCHASE_DATE_EXPIRATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Expiration date calculation details
    - `verify_iap_implementation.md` - Implementation verification checklist
  - **Fixed Test Case Numbering:** Resolved duplicate test case numbers in manual test documentation
  - **Enhanced TransactionObserver Tests:** Added comprehensive unit tests for subscription transaction handling

- **ðŸ§ª IAP Test Coverage Enhancement:**
  - **Re-enabled EntitlementManagerTests.swift:** Fixed property access issues, 9 test methods covering subscription status and feature access
  - **Created PurchaseServiceTests.swift:** Brand new file with 13 test methods covering purchase flows, cancellation, and failure handling (TC-004 to TC-007)
  - **Fixed SubscriptionIntegrationTests.swift:** Resolved property assignment issues, updated method signatures for SubscriptionProduct pricing
  - **Technical Fixes Applied:** Replaced direct property assignments with service method calls, fixed mock service conflicts, corrected StoreKit integration approach

- **ðŸŽ¯ MAJOR: Prompting System Refactoring (Phase 1 Complete)**
  - **FluentPromptBuilder:** Implemented composable fluent API for type-safe prompt construction
    - Chainable methods: `.story()`, `.character()`, `.vocabulary()`, `.moral()`
    - Eliminated 300+ lines of duplicated prompt code
    - 18 comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
  - **AIGenerationStrategy:** Implemented strategy pattern for AI model selection
    - `GeminiTextStrategy`, `GeminiImageStrategy`, `ImagenStrategy` 
    - `AIStrategySelector` and `AICoordinator` for intelligent model routing
    - 12 comprehensive tests covering all strategies and error scenarios
  - **ConfigurablePromptTemplates:** External JSON-based template management
    - A/B testing support with template variants
    - Text-free enforcement system with multiple levels
    - Centralized template substitution system
    - 10 tests covering template loading and substitution
  - **Code Quality Improvements:**
    - Made protocols and structs public with proper access control
    - Fixed StoryParameters constructor signature consistency
    - Resolved mock declaration conflicts in test files
    - Maintained backward compatibility throughout refactoring

- Previous UI/Navigation Work:
  - Centralized navigation using `AppRouter` and `AppDestination` enum
  - Standardized `UITheme` design system implementation
  - Removed deprecated keyboard handling extensions

## Next Steps
- **Test Coverage Continuation:**
  - Systematically re-enable remaining 40+ disabled test files
  - Fix compilation and property access issues in disabled tests
  - Maintain test coverage improvements for IAP and core functionality
- **Phase 2 Implementation:**
  - Implement Combine-based event system for reactive prompt updates
  - Add actor-based prompt coordination for better concurrency
- **Phase 3 Planning:**
  - Create type-safe prompt DSL with result builders
- **Testing & Integration:**
  - Ensure 100% test coverage across all new components
  - Integration testing with existing story generation flows
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Profile prompt generation performance
  - Optimize AI model selection logic

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Consolidating navigation logic into the `AppRouter` to simplify individual views and make navigation more predictable.
- Standardizing the design system through `UITheme` to ensure visual consistency and ease of maintenance.
- Streamlining the codebase by removing unused or redundant components, such as keyboard handling extensions.
- Transitioning from passing full model objects to using identifiers in navigation to reduce memory usage and improve state management.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Follow the Memory Bank structure and update protocols defined in `memory.instructions.md`.
- Adhere to Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices as defined in `tdd.instructions.md` for future coding tasks.
- Use the Router pattern for navigation through the `AppRouter` class.
- Consistently apply `UITheme` for all visual styling.
- Prefer ID-based navigation over passing full objects between views.
- Maintain documentation meticulously.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project is an iOS application called "Magical Stories."
- It uses SwiftUI, SwiftData, and Google AI for story and illustration generation.
- Key features include personalized story generation, a story library, growth collections, and parental controls.
- Monetization is planned via StoreKit 2.
- There's a strong emphasis on testing (unit, integration, UI, snapshot).
- The centralized navigation approach with `AppRouter` has significantly simplified navigation management.
- The consolidated design system with `UITheme` provides more consistent visual appearance and easier maintenance.
- ID-based navigation to StoryDetailView improves memory usage and state management.
- Built-in SwiftUI keyboard handling is preferred over custom keyboard management extensions.
