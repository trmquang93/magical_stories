# Progress: Magical Stories

## What Works
Based on the available information, the following aspects are understood to be in place or progressing:

*   **Core Project Setup:** Xcode project structure, basic configurations.
*   **AI Integration:** Google AI (Gemini Pro for text, Imagen for images) is integrated for story and illustration generation. Services like `StoryService` and `IllustrationService` manage these interactions.
*   **Persistence:** SwiftData is the primary data store. Repositories abstract data access.
*   **UI Framework:** SwiftUI is used for the user interface.
*   **Navigation System:** Centralized navigation using `AppRouter` with type-safe `AppDestination` enum.
*   **Design System:** Standardized `UITheme` with consistent color palettes, spacing, and gradients.
*   **Key Features (Partially or Fully Implemented):**
    *   Personalized story generation.
    *   Illustration generation (including asynchronous processing and placeholder UI).
    *   Story library.
    *   Growth Collections (core models, service layer, and some UI, including swipe-to-delete).
    *   `CollectionsListView` is integrated as a tab in `MainTabView`.
*   **Monetization:** StoreKit 2 integration is planned, with `PurchaseService` and `EntitlementManager` likely in early stages or defined.
*   **Testing:** A testing framework is established, including unit tests (Swift Testing), UI tests (XCTest), and snapshot tests (SnapshotTesting). Guidelines and some tests exist, particularly for `LibraryView` and illustration generation UI states.
*   **Documentation:** A significant amount of documentation exists in the `documents/` directory, covering architecture, APIs, UI, testing, and operations. The Memory Bank structure itself is also documented.
*   **Build/Test Scripts:** `run_tests.sh` and `fix_build.sh` exist.

## What's Left to Build/Verify
This is an initial assessment and will require deeper dives into specific areas:

*   **Full Feature Completeness:**
    *   Parental Controls: Detailed implementation status is unclear.
    *   Story Reading Experience: Specifics of `StoryDetailView`, pagination, and progress bar need review.
    *   Growth Collections: UI polish, achievement/badge system, and full end-to-end flow testing.
    *   Monetization: Full implementation of purchase flows, entitlement gating, restore purchases, and UI for paywalls/upgrades.
*   **UI/UX Polish:** Comprehensive UI/UX review and refinement across all features, including accessibility and animations.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling across all layers and user-facing alerts.
*   **Performance Optimization:** App launch time, story generation speed, UI responsiveness.
*   **Security:** Full review and implementation of security best practices.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Achieving target test coverage across all categories (unit, integration, UI, snapshot).
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Ensuring the CI/CD pipeline is fully operational for builds, tests, and deployments.
*   **App Store Submission Readiness:** Metadata, screenshots, compliance checks.

## Current Status
- The project is in an active development phase, with significant refactoring work recently completed.
- A centralized navigation system using the Router pattern has been implemented through `AppRouter`.
- The UI theme system has been standardized and consolidated into `UITheme`.
- Code cleaning efforts are ongoing, including removal of unused keyboard handling extensions.
- Navigation flows from HomeView, LibraryView, and SettingsView now consistently use AppRouter.

## Known Issues (from existing documentation or general inference)
- **TTS Removal:** Text-to-Speech functionality was explicitly removed; need to ensure all remnants are gone and documentation reflects this.
- **Illustration Generation UX:** The `illustration-generation-ux-plan.md` suggests ongoing work and considerations for improving this experience (e.g., bulk retry, caching).
- **Technical Debt & Maintenance:** As with any project, ongoing attention to technical debt, dependency updates, and performance monitoring will be required (as noted in `technical-roadmap.md`).

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Shift from "Growth Path Stories" to "Growth Collections":** The project initially considered a concept called "Growth Path Stories" which has been superseded by "Growth Collections."
- **Illustration Generation API:** Updated to use Gemini 2.0 multimodal API for better page-to-page consistency, with Imagen as a fallback.
- **Testing Standards:** Adoption of Swift Testing as the primary framework and a standard for UI and snapshot testing for major features.
- **Navigation Architecture:** Shifted from decentralized navigation in each view to the centralized `AppRouter` pattern for better maintainability and consistency.
- **Theme System Consolidation:** Evolved from a fragmented `Theme` approach to a comprehensive `UITheme` design system.
- **Simplified Keyboard Handling:** Removed custom keyboard extensions in favor of built-in SwiftUI solutions.
