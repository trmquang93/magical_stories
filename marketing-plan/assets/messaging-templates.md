#### Media Pitch Templates

**Tech Media Pitch:**
```
Subject: First AI app to solve character consistency in children's stories launches today

Hi [Journalist Name],

I wanted to share a breakthrough in AI technology that specifically addresses children's content - something I know [publication] covers extensively.

The problem: AI-generated images typically create different-looking characters on every page, making stories confusing and less engaging for children.

The solution: Magical Stories has developed the first AI system that maintains perfect character consistency across all story pages, creating cohesive visual narratives that rival professionally illustrated books.

Why this matters:
‚Ä¢ Technical achievement: Solving a significant AI limitation
‚Ä¢ Market impact: $4.2B children's app market opportunity
‚Ä¢ Child development: Research-backed benefits for engagement and learning

Would you be interested in a demo? I can show you the technology in action and explain the breakthrough that makes this possible.

The app launches today with features including:
- Character-consistent AI illustrations
- Stories in 10 languages
- Growth path collections designed by child development experts
- Privacy-first design with comprehensive parental controls

Happy to provide more details or arrange an interview with our founder.

Best,

#### FAQ Responses

**Character Consistency Question:**
```
Great question! Character consistency is our signature feature and here's how it works:

Our AI technology creates a visual "reference" for each character in your story, then uses that reference to ensure the character looks exactly the same on every page. This is different from other AI image generators that create new, random-looking characters each time.

Why this matters for your child:
- Easier to follow the story when characters look consistent
- Stronger emotional connection to familiar-looking characters  
- More engaging reading experience overall

You can see this in action by creating any story - watch how [character name] looks exactly the same from page 1 to the end!

Let me know if you'd like me to walk you through creating your first story!
```

**Educational Value Question:**
```
Absolutely! Our stories are designed by child development experts to support specific learning goals:

Growth Path Collections include:
üß† Problem-Solving Adventures (ages 4-8)
‚ù§Ô∏è Empathy & Friendship Stories (ages 3-7)  
üí™ Confidence Building Tales (ages 5-9)
üåç Cultural Awareness Stories (ages 4-10)

Each collection targets specific developmental milestones with age-appropriate content and scenarios. The personalization ensures your child sees themselves in situations that help them practice and learn new skills.

Want to explore a specific area of development? I can recommend the perfect collection for your child's age and interests!
