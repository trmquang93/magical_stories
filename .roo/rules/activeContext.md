# Active Context (as of 2025-04-23)

## Current Focus
The primary focus remains on **finalizing the Growth Path Collections feature**. Core models, services, and UI are implemented. Recent work involved documenting the user flow, integration points, and outstanding tasks for full feature completion. Documentation and Memory Bank have been updated to reflect the current state and next steps.

### Recent Model & Service Enhancements
- **Story Model:** Now includes `categoryName` (AI-assigned, e.g., Fantasy, Animals, Bedtime, Adventure) and supports robust relationships with collections and pages.
- **StoryParameters:** Supports optional `developmentalFocus`, `interactiveElements`, and `emotionalThemes` for richer, more tailored story generation.
- **PromptBuilder:** Constructs prompts with vocabulary/narrative guidelines, developmental/emotional focus, and instructs the AI to return a JSON object with both story and category. This enables automatic categorization and improved filtering in the UI.
- **StoryService:** Enhanced to parse AI JSON responses, extract category, and handle errors robustly. Now supports dependency injection for easier testing and extension.
- **LibraryView:** Integrates category-based filtering, search, and improved accessibility. UI patterns for category cards and story cards are standardized and leverage the design system.

### Growth Path Collections: User Flow
1. Access Collections via the dedicated tab in MainTabView
2. Browse collection cards with progress indicators
3. Tap a collection to view its stories and progress
4. Read a story; upon completion, progress is updated
5. Create a new collection via Home tab (CollectionFormView)
6. Progress and achievements (planned) are reflected in the UI

### Integration Points
- Models: `StoryCollection`, `GrowthCategory`, `StoryModel` (with `readCount`, `lastReadAt`, `isCompleted`, `categoryName`)
- Services: `CollectionService`, `CollectionRepository`, `StoryService`
- UI: `CollectionsListView`, `CollectionCardView`, `CollectionDetailView`, `CollectionFormView`, `StoryDetailView`, `LibraryView`
- Persistence: SwiftData via repositories
- Progress Tracking: Implemented and tested (story completion updates collection progress)
- Testing: Unit and integration tests exist for core flows

### Outstanding Tasks
- Ensure Collections tab is present and fully integrated in `MainTabView`
- Finalize navigation and destination logic for all collection-related views
- Complete end-to-end and edge case testing for the full user flow
- Polish UI/UX for all collection views, ensuring accessibility and feedback
- Implement (optional) achievement/badge logic and UI
- Update all relevant documentation and Memory Bank after each change

## Next Steps
- Complete T6 (tab integration if not done)
- Proceed with T7 (testing, UI/UX, accessibility)
- (Optionally) Implement T8 (achievements)
- Update all documentation and Memory Bank (T9)

## Recent Updates
### [Update 2025-04-23] Navigation Fix for AllStoriesView
- Fixed an issue where tapping the back button in StoryDetailView when accessed from AllStoriesView would incorrectly pop back to LibraryView (root) instead of remaining on StoryDetailView.
- Root cause: AllStoriesView had an unnecessary nested NavigationStack, and LibraryView used inconsistent navigation patterns.
- Solutions: (1) Removed the redundant NavigationStack from AllStoriesView while keeping the navigationDestination modifier, and (2) Updated LibraryView's "See All" button to use NavigationLink(value: ViewDestination.allStories) for consistent navigation.
- Created a UI test (testAllStoriesView_StoryDetailNavigation) to verify proper navigation behavior.
- Updated systemPatterns.md with best practices for SwiftUI navigation to prevent similar issues in future development.
