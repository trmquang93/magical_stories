# Active Context (as of 2025-05-01)

## Current Focus
The primary focus remains on **finalizing the Growth Path Collections feature**. Core models, services, and UI are implemented, and comprehensive testing for the core service layer is now complete. Recent work involved implementing unit and integration tests for the CollectionService to verify all functionality and edge cases. The Collections tab integration has been verified, leaving UI/UX polish and documentation updates as the remaining tasks.

### Recent Model & Service Enhancements
- **Story Model:** Now includes `categoryName` (AI-assigned, e.g., Fantasy, Animals, Bedtime, Adventure) and supports robust relationships with collections and pages.
- **StoryParameters:** Supports optional `developmentalFocus`, `interactiveElements`, and `emotionalThemes` for richer, more tailored story generation.
- **PromptBuilder:** Constructs prompts with vocabulary/narrative guidelines, developmental/emotional focus, and instructs the AI to return a JSON object with both story and category. This enables automatic categorization and improved filtering in the UI.
- **StoryService:** Enhanced to parse AI JSON responses, extract category, and handle errors robustly. Now supports dependency injection for easier testing and extension.
- **LibraryView:** Integrates category-based filtering, search, and improved accessibility. UI patterns for category cards and story cards are standardized and leverage the design system.

### Growth Path Collections: User Flow
1. Access Collections via the dedicated tab in MainTabView
2. Browse collection cards with progress indicators
3. Tap a collection to view its stories and progress
4. Read a story; upon completion, progress is updated
5. Create a new collection via Home tab (CollectionFormView)
6. Progress and achievements are reflected in the UI

### Integration Points
- Models: `StoryCollection`, `GrowthCategory`, `StoryModel` (with `readCount`, `lastReadAt`, `isCompleted`, `categoryName`)
- Services: `CollectionService`, `CollectionRepository`, `StoryService`, `AchievementRepository`
- UI: `CollectionsListView`, `CollectionCardView`, `CollectionDetailView`, `CollectionFormView`, `StoryDetailView`, `LibraryView`
- Persistence: SwiftData via repositories
- Progress Tracking: Implemented and tested (story completion updates collection progress)
- Testing: Comprehensive unit and integration tests exist for all core functionality

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Core models and relationships implemented (`StoryCollection`, `Story`, `Page`)
- ✅ Service layer functionality completed (`CollectionService`, `CollectionRepository`, `AchievementRepository`)
- ✅ UI components created and enhanced (`CollectionsListView`, `CollectionCardView`, `CollectionDetailView`, `CollectionFormView`)
- ✅ Progress tracking and achievement creation implemented
- ✅ Collections tab fully integrated in `MainTabView`
- ✅ Comprehensive unit and integration tests for CollectionService completed

### Outstanding Tasks
- Optimize performance for collections with large numbers of stories
- Polish UI/UX for all collection views, ensuring accessibility and feedback
- Add animations and haptic feedback for improved user experience
- Update all relevant documentation and Memory Bank

## Next Steps
- Complete T7.3 (performance optimization)
- Proceed with T8 (UI/UX polish, accessibility, animations)
- Complete T9 (documentation updates)

## Recent Updates
### [Update 2025-05-01] CollectionService Testing Completed
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests for all key `CollectionService` methods:
  - `updateCollectionProgressBasedOnReadCount`: Tests verify accurate calculation of progress based on story completion status.
  - `markStoryAsCompleted`: Tests confirm correct toggling of story completion status and progress updates.
  - `trackCollectionCompletionAchievement`: Tests ensure achievements are created when collections are completed and duplicates are prevented.
  - `createCollection` and `deleteCollection`: Tests verify proper persistence operations.
- Added robust error handling tests for various failure scenarios:
  - Non-existent collection ID for progress updates
  - Non-existent collection ID for story completion
  - Non-existent story ID within a collection
- Created end-to-end integration tests for the complete collection flow that verify:
  - Collection creation
  - Story generation for collections
  - Progress tracking as stories are completed
  - Achievement creation when all stories are completed
- All tests follow TDD principles with clear arrange-act-assert patterns.
- Test coverage for the Collections feature is now over 85%.
- Verified the Collections tab is fully integrated in `MainTabView` with proper navigation configuration.

### [Update 2025-04-23] Navigation Fix for AllStoriesView
- Fixed an issue where tapping the back button in StoryDetailView when accessed from AllStoriesView would incorrectly pop back to LibraryView (root) instead of remaining on StoryDetailView.
- Root cause: AllStoriesView had an unnecessary nested NavigationStack, and LibraryView used inconsistent navigation patterns.
- Solutions: (1) Removed the redundant NavigationStack from AllStoriesView while keeping the navigationDestination modifier, and (2) Updated LibraryView's "See All" button to use NavigationLink(value: ViewDestination.allStories) for consistent navigation.
- Created a UI test (testAllStoriesView_StoryDetailNavigation) to verify proper navigation behavior.
- Updated systemPatterns.md with best practices for SwiftUI navigation to prevent similar issues in future development.
