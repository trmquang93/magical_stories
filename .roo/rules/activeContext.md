# Active Context (as of 2025-04-16)

## Current Focus
The primary focus remains on **implementing the Growth Collections feature**. Core models and services are in place. Recent work involved reviewing existing UI components and refining the implementation plan.

1.  **Growth Collections:** Implementation ongoing.
    *   Core models (`StoryCollection`, `GrowthCategory`), repository (`CollectionRepository`), and service (`CollectionService`) created.
    *   Basic UI views (`CollectionsListView`, `CollectionCardView`, `CollectionDetailView`, `CollectionFormView`) exist.
    *   `HomeView` integrates the "Create Collection" button and `CollectionFormView`.
    *   `CollectionFormView` handles input and triggers collection creation and initial story generation via `CollectionService`.
    *   `CollectionsListView` uses `@Query` for data fetching.
    *   `CollectionDetailView` displays stories but contains incorrect progress update logic that needs removal.
    *   Navigation uses `NavigationLink(value:)`.
    *   Progress tracking relies on `StoryModel.readCount` and `StoryCollection.completionProgress`.
    *   Refined plan created (see Next Steps).
2.  **StoreKit Integration:** Detailed design completed, awaiting implementation after Growth Collections.
3.  **UI/UX Refinement:** Upcoming focus.
4.  **Accessibility Improvements:** Upcoming focus.

## Recent Changes (Completion & Verification)

*   **Growth Collections Code Review & Plan Refinement:**
    *   Reviewed `CollectionsListView`, `CollectionCardView`, `CollectionDetailView`, `CollectionFormView`, and `StoryDataModels.swift`.
    *   Confirmed `CollectionsListView` uses `@Query`.
    *   Confirmed `CollectionCardView` displays `completionProgress`.
    *   Identified incorrect progress update logic (`toggleStoryCompletion` using non-existent `isCompleted` property) in `CollectionDetailView` for removal.
    *   Confirmed `CollectionFormView` correctly triggers `collectionService.createCollection` and `collectionService.generateStoriesForCollection`.
    *   Confirmed `StoryModel` uses `readCount` and `lastReadAt` for progress.
    *   Refined the implementation plan based on these findings.

*   **Growth Collections Initial Setup:**
    *   Implemented `StoryCollection` model with SwiftData integration.
    *   Created `GrowthCategory` enum.
    *   Developed `CollectionService` with basic CRUD operations.
    *   Defined relationship between `Story` and `StoryCollection` models.
    *   Added "Create Collection" button action in `HomeView.swift`.
    *   Integrated `CollectionFormView` with `CollectionService`.
    *   Updated `HomeView` preview provider.

*   **Google AI Integration Verified:** (No changes since last update)
    *   Confirmed API key usage.
    *   Verified image generation model.
    *   Validated response parsing.

*   **IllustrationService Implementation Completed:** (No changes since last update)
    *   Uses direct REST API calls.
    *   Detailed prompts, retry logic, error handling via `IllustrationError` and `AIErrorManager`.
    *   Saves images to persistent storage.
    *   Fully integrated.

*   **Testing Strategy Implemented:** (No changes since last update)
    *   Improved mocking, migrated tests to Swift Testing.
    *   Increased coverage.

*   **Story Saving & UI Refresh Fixes:** (No changes since last update)
    *   Fixed async timing bug.
    *   Stories appear immediately in LibraryView.

*   **Migration Cleanup:** (No changes since last update)
    *   Removed UserDefaults migration logic/tests.
