## Current Focus
The primary focus remains on **implementing the Growth Collections feature**. Core models and services are in place. Recent work involved reviewing existing UI components and refining the implementation plan.

### [Update 2025-04-16] Step T2 Complete: Refactor and Enhance CollectionDetailView
- CollectionDetailView was refactored to use `@Bindable` for more reactive state management.
- The deprecated `toggleStoryCompletion` function and button were removed as progress should be based on reading stories.
- UI now uses `Story.isCompleted` for the completion indicator instead of the non-existent `readCount` property.
- Added a `storyRow` helper function to resolve type-checking performance issues in complex SwiftUI views.
- Added `.navigationDestination(for: Story.self)` with a placeholder for StoryDetailView.
- Created `CollectionDetailView_Tests.swift` with tests that verify collection data, progress values, and state updates.
- Test suite follows best practices for testing SwiftUI views, focusing on model state validation.
- Next step (T3) will focus on enhancing `CollectionService` logic for better integration with the progress tracking flow.
