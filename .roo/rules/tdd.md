# Test-Driven Development Workflow

## Overview

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the code that needs to be implemented. This document provides guidance on how the AI Editor Modes System should follow the TDD workflow to ensure robust, well-tested code.

## Core TDD Principles

1. **Tests First**: Write tests before implementing functionality
2. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Follow the cycle of failing test, passing implementation, and code improvement
3. **Incremental Development**: Build functionality in small, testable increments
4. **Regression Prevention**: Maintain and run the full test suite to prevent regressions
5. **Design Improvement**: Use tests as a driver for better software design
6. **Continuous Verification**: Ensure all code is verified by automated tests

## TDD Cycle in the AI Editor Modes System

The TDD cycle in our system involves collaboration between multiple specialized modes, each with specific responsibilities:

### 1. Test Writing Phase (Red)

**Primary Mode**: Testing Mode
**Supporting Modes**: Architect Mode (for design guidance), Manager Mode (for requirement clarification)

**Steps**:
1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Testing Mode reviews the requirements with Manager Mode
   - Clarifies acceptance criteria and expected behavior
   
2. **Test Design**:
   - Testing Mode designs test cases covering normal flows, edge cases, and error scenarios
   - Consults with Architect Mode on integration points and design constraints
   
3. **Test Implementation**:
   - Testing Mode writes automated tests that express the expected behavior
   - Ensures tests are failing appropriately (verifying they detect the absence of functionality)
   - Documents test coverage and test expectations

**Handoff**: Testing Mode provides a summary of implemented tests, expected failures, and implementation guidance to Code Mode.

### 2. Implementation Phase (Green)

**Primary Mode**: Code Mode
**Supporting Mode**: Testing Mode (for test clarification)

**Steps**:
1. **Review Tests**:
   - Code Mode reviews the failing tests to understand requirements
   - Clarifies any ambiguities with Testing Mode
   
2. **Minimal Implementation**:
   - Implements the minimal code necessary to pass the tests
   - Focuses on making tests pass, not on perfect design
   - Avoids implementing untested functionality
   
3. **Verification**:
   - Runs tests to confirm implementation satisfies requirements
   - Addresses any remaining test failures

**Handoff**: Code Mode signals to Debug Mode that implementation is complete with passing tests.

### 3. Refactoring Phase (Refactor)

**Primary Mode**: Debug Mode
**Supporting Modes**: Code Mode, Architect Mode

**Steps**:
1. **Code Quality Review**:
   - Debug Mode reviews the implemented code for quality issues
   - Identifies opportunities for refactoring
   
2. **Refactoring**:
   - Improves code structure, readability, and maintainability
   - Eliminates duplication and applies appropriate design patterns
   - Ensures all tests continue to pass after each refactoring step
   
3. **Final Verification**:
   - Runs the full test suite to verify refactoring hasn't broken existing functionality
   - Performs additional checks for performance or other non-functional requirements

**Handoff**: Debug Mode provides a summary of refactoring changes and verification results to Manager Mode.

### 4. Cycle Completion

**Primary Mode**: Manager Mode
**Supporting Modes**: All involved modes

**Steps**:
1. **Review Cycle Results**:
   - Manager Mode assesses if the functionality meets requirements
   - Verifies all tests are passing and code quality is acceptable
   
2. **Documentation Update**:
   - Documentation Mode updates relevant documentation with new functionality
   
3. **Next Cycle Planning**:
   - Manager Mode determines the next feature or component for TDD
   - Restarts the cycle with Testing Mode for the next increment

## Best Practices

1. **Small Increments**:
   - Keep each TDD cycle focused on a single responsibility or feature
   - Break complex features into multiple TDD cycles
   
2. **Complete Test Coverage**:
   - Ensure tests cover normal cases, edge cases, and error handling
   - Include both unit tests and integration tests as appropriate
   
3. **Maintain Test Quality**:
   - Tests should be readable, maintainable, and deterministic
   - Avoid testing implementation details, focus on behavior
   
4. **Fast Feedback Loop**:
   - Tests should run quickly to maintain development momentum
   - Optimize the test execution environment for speed
   
5. **Test Independence**:
   - Each test should be independent and self-contained
   - Avoid dependencies between test cases
   
6. **Cross-Mode Collaboration**:
   - Encourage clear communication between modes during handoffs
   - Provide complete context to the next mode in the cycle
   
7. **Traceability**:
   - Maintain clear links between requirements, tests, and implementations
   - Document key decisions and design considerations

## Mode-Specific Responsibilities

### Testing Mode
- Write comprehensive test cases before implementation
- Verify test failures before implementation
- Confirm test passes after implementation
- Maintain and evolve test suites

### Code Mode
- Implement minimal code to pass tests
- Focus on satisfying requirements before optimization
- Collaborate with Testing Mode to clarify test intentions

### Debug Mode
- Perform rigorous refactoring while preserving test passing status
- Apply best practices and design patterns
- Ensure code quality meets project standards

### Architect Mode
- Provide guidance on system design implications
- Ensure tests and implementations align with overall architecture
- Review for consistency with architectural principles

### Manager Mode
- Coordinate the TDD workflow across modes
- Ensure requirements are clearly defined for test writing
- Verify cycle completion before starting new cycles

## Metrics and Evaluation

The effectiveness of the TDD workflow should be evaluated using:

1. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by automated tests
2. **Defect Rate**: Number of defects discovered after implementation
3. **Cycle Time**: Time taken to complete a full TDD cycle
4. **Maintainability Index**: Measure of code quality and maintainability
5. **Regression Rate**: Frequency of reintroducing previously fixed issues

Each mode should track and report these metrics as appropriate to continuously improve the TDD process.
