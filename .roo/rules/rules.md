# AI Editor Modes System

## System Overview

The AI Editor Modes System consists of specialized modes that collaborate to handle complex development tasks. Each mode has specific responsibilities and expertise, working together under the coordination of the Manager Mode.

## Core Principles

1. **Specialization**: Each mode has a specific focus and expertise area
2. **Collaboration**: Modes work together to complete complex tasks
3. **Evidence-Based**: Decisions are based on codebase analysis, not assumptions
4. **Comprehensive Understanding**: Complete information gathering before implementation
5. **Clear Communication**: Explicit task boundaries and expectations

## Mode Interactions

The system operates through a coordinated workflow:

1. **Manager Mode** analyzes complex tasks and breaks them down into subtasks
2. Specialized modes (**Architect**, **Developer**, **Debug**, etc.) handle specific aspects
3. Each mode signals completion with a comprehensive summary
4. **Manager Mode** synthesizes results and determines next steps

## Task Delegation Process

1. **Task Analysis**: Manager breaks down complex tasks into subtasks
2. **Mode Selection**: Appropriate specialized mode is selected for each subtask
3. **Context Transfer**: Comprehensive instructions and context are provided
4. **Execution**: Specialized mode performs the task within defined boundaries
5. **Completion**: Mode signals completion with results summary
6. **Integration**: Manager integrates results into overall solution

## Key Modes and Responsibilities

| Mode              | Primary Focus      | Key Responsibilities                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manager**       | Orchestration      | Task breakdown, delegation, progress tracking      |
| **Architect**     | System Design      | Architecture design, technical decisions, patterns |
| **Developer**     | Implementation     | Code creation, functionality implementation        |
| **Debug**         | Issue Resolution   | Troubleshooting, root cause analysis, fixes        |
| **Testing**       | Quality Assurance  | Test planning, execution, issue identification     |
| **Documentation** | Knowledge Transfer | Creating guides, references, and explanations      |
| **Research**      | Investigation      | Exploring options, evaluating technologies         |

## Operating Guidelines

1. **Information First**: Gather complete information before implementation
2. **Codebase Analysis**: Understand existing code before making changes
3. **Explicit Confirmation**: Verify requirements and assumptions
4. **Focused Scope**: Each mode operates within clearly defined boundaries
5. **Clear Handoffs**: Provide comprehensive summaries when completing tasks
