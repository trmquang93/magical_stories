# Project Progress: Magical Stories (as of 2025-04-15)

## What Works / Implemented Features

-   **Core App Structure:** Basic SwiftUI app structure with `TabView` navigation (Home, Library, Settings) is in place.
-   **Story Generation:**
    -   UI (`StoryFormView`) exists for inputting parameters.
    -   `StoryService` uses the **real Google Generative AI API** (via `GenerativeModelProtocol`) to generate story content based on parameters.
-   **Story Library:**
    -   `LibraryView` displays saved stories.
    -   Stories are persisted locally using **SwiftData** as the primary storage.
-   **Story Reading:**
    -   `StoryDetailView` displays story content, paginated using `TabView`.
    -   Page indicator and progress bar are functional.
-   **Settings:**
    -   `SettingsView` allows configuration of app settings and parental controls.
    -   `SettingsService` manages and persists these settings using **SwiftData**.
-   **Parental Controls:** Basic controls for content filtering (theme, age) and screen time (max stories per day) are implemented in `SettingsService`.
-   **Testing (Improved):**
    -   Comprehensive unit tests (using **Swift Testing**) and UI tests (using XCTest) cover key components.
    -   Successfully migrated relevant tests to the Swift Testing framework.
    -   Implemented robust mocking strategies, eliminating live API calls during unit tests.
    -   Added integration tests for critical user flows (e.g., story reading).
    -   Test coverage significantly increased.
    -   A test script (`run_tests.sh`) is available for consistent test execution.
    -   All tests passing with fixed build errors and test failures.
-   **Core Models:** Standardized core data models (`Story`, `StoryParameters`).
-   **Persistence:** Fully integrated **SwiftData** as the primary persistence layer. Legacy UserDefaults migration code and tests have been removed.
-   **Illustration Generation (Fully Implemented & Integrated):**

    The `IllustrationService` is now fully operational, completing the core feature for automated illustration generation based on story content. It:

    *   Generates illustrations by making **direct REST API calls** to Google's Generative AI endpoint.
    *   Constructs **detailed prompts** with specific constraints (e.g., no anthropomorphic animals).
    *   Implements **retry logic** (up to 5 attempts with delay) and **comprehensive error handling**.
    *   Saves generated images to **persistent app storage** (`Application Support/Illustrations`), storing **relative paths** in the model.
    *   Logs errors and issues via the centralized `AIErrorManager`.
    *   Supports **manual regeneration** via UI if initial generation fails.
    *   Has been **verified** with correct API key, model (`gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation`), and response parsing (base64 `inlineData`).
    *   All related tests have been updated and are passing.

    This completes the main functionality for automated illustration generation. Minor future improvements (e.g., prompt tuning, UI polish) may be made, but the core system is feature-complete.

-   **Error Handling:**
    *   Created AIErrorManager for centralized error management.
    *   Enhanced error handling for AI API interactions (text and image generation).
    *   Implemented graceful fallbacks with placeholder images for illustration failures.
    *   Added comprehensive logging and user-friendly error messages.

-   **Recent Fixes:**
    *   Story creation, saving, and immediate display in LibraryView now work reliably.
    *   Debugging and error visibility improved.

-   **Growth Collections (Implementation In Progress):**
    *   Core models implemented:
        *   Created `StoryCollection` data model with SwiftData annotations and relationship to `Story` model.
        *   Implemented `GrowthCategory` enum to represent developmental categories.
    *   Basic service layer:
        *   Created `CollectionService` with CRUD operations.
        *   Set up repository pattern for data access.
    *   Testing:
        *   Started creating unit tests for models and service layer.
        *   Integration tests for validating collection creation and fetching functionality.
    *   Remaining work:
        *   Complete UI implementation (`CollectionsView`, `CollectionDetailView`, `CollectionFormView`).
        *   Implement progress tracking and achievement system.
        *   Integrate with existing story reading flow.
        *   Add additional service methods for generating content and tracking progress.

## What's Left / Next Steps

-   **Growth Story Collections:** Continue implementation with the following:
    *   UI components: Collections list, detail view, form for creating collections.
    *   Progress tracking and achievement integration.
    *   Integration with existing story generation and reading flows.
    *   Advanced features like personalized collection generation.

-   **StoreKit Integration:** Planned and designed feature; implementation has not yet begun. This is a next priority after Growth Collections is more mature.
    *   Implement `PurchaseService` for handling in-app purchases and subscriptions.
    *   Create `EntitlementManager` for tracking user access to premium features.
    *   Design and implement paywall UI for upgrading to premium.
    *   Integrate with Growth Collections for premium content.

-   **UI Polishing:** Further refinement of UI elements, animations, and overall user experience, including illustration display.

-   **Error Handling:** Continue enhancing error handling for persistence operations and general app errors.

-   **Accessibility:** Thorough accessibility testing and implementation needed.

-   **CI/CD:** Review and refine CI/CD setup.

-   **Test Improvements:**
    *   Continue increasing test coverage towards target (e.g., 70%+).
    *   Add more view-based tests using descendant mirror pattern.
