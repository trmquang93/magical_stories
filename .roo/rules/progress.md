# Project Progress: Magical Stories (as of 2025-04-16)

## What Works / Implemented Features

-   **Core App Structure:** Basic SwiftUI app structure with `TabView` navigation (Home, Library, Settings) is in place.
-   **Story Generation:**
    -   UI (`StoryFormView`) exists for inputting parameters.
    -   `StoryService` uses the **real Google Generative AI API** (via `GenerativeModelProtocol`) to generate story content based on parameters.
-   **Story Library:**
    -   `LibraryView` displays saved stories.
    -   Stories are persisted locally using **SwiftData** as the primary storage.
-   **Story Reading:**
    -   `StoryDetailView` displays story content, paginated using `TabView`.
    -   Page indicator and progress bar are functional.
-   **Settings:**
    -   `SettingsView` allows configuration of app settings and parental controls.
    -   `SettingsService` manages and persists these settings using **SwiftData**.
-   **Parental Controls:** Basic controls for content filtering (theme, age) and screen time (max stories per day) are implemented in `SettingsService`.
-   **Testing (Improved):**
    -   Comprehensive unit tests (using **Swift Testing**) and UI tests (using XCTest) cover key components.
    -   Successfully migrated relevant tests to the Swift Testing framework.
    -   Implemented robust mocking strategies, eliminating live API calls during unit tests.
    -   Added integration tests for critical user flows (e.g., story reading).
    -   Test coverage significantly increased.
    -   A test script (`run_tests.sh`) is available for consistent test execution.
    -   All tests passing with fixed build errors and test failures.
-   **Core Models:** Standardized core data models (`StoryModel`, `PageModel`, `StoryCollection`, `GrowthCategory`).
-   **Persistence:** Fully integrated **SwiftData** as the primary persistence layer. Legacy UserDefaults migration code and tests have been removed.
-   **Illustration Generation (Fully Implemented & Integrated):**
    *   Uses **direct REST API calls** to Google's Generative AI endpoint.
    *   Constructs **detailed prompts** with constraints.
    *   Implements **retry logic** and **comprehensive error handling**.
    *   Saves generated images to **persistent app storage**.
    *   Logs errors via `AIErrorManager`.
    *   Fully **integrated and operational**.
-   **Error Handling:**
    *   `AIErrorManager` for centralized AI error management.
    *   Enhanced error handling for AI API interactions.
    *   Graceful fallbacks for illustration failures.
    *   Comprehensive logging and user-friendly error messages.
-   **Recent Fixes:**
    *   Story creation, saving, and immediate display in LibraryView work reliably.
    *   Debugging and error visibility improved.

-   **Growth Collections (Implementation In Progress):**
    *   **Core Models:** `StoryCollection`, `GrowthCategory` implemented with SwiftData. Relationship with `StoryModel` defined.
    *   **Service Layer:** `CollectionService` and `CollectionRepository` created with basic CRUD operations.
    *   **UI Components:**
        *   `CollectionsListView`: Exists, uses `@Query` for data fetching, basic search implemented. Uses `NavigationLink(value:)`. **[T1 Complete: Refactored, navigation ensured, test coverage added, not yet integrated in main UI]**
        *   `CollectionCardView`: Exists, displays collection info and `completionProgress`. **[T1 Complete: Refactored, accessibility improved]**
        *   `CollectionDetailView`: Exists, displays stories, uses `NavigationLink(value:)`. Contains *incorrect* progress update logic (`toggleStoryCompletion`) that needs removal.
        *   `CollectionFormView`: Exists, captures input, creates collection shell via `CollectionService`, and triggers story generation via `CollectionService`. Handles internal loading/error states.
    *   **Integration:**
        *   `HomeView` presents `CollectionFormView` via a button.
    *   **Progress Tracking:** Relies on `StoryModel.readCount` and `StoryCollection.completionProgress`.
    *   **Testing:** Initial unit and integration tests for models and service layer exist. **[T1: CollectionsListView_Tests.swift created]**

## Recently Completed

**T1: Finalize `CollectionsListView` Integration (Complete)**
- Refactored `CollectionsListView` and `CollectionCardView` for clarity, accessibility, and future integration.
- Ensured `.navigationDestination(for: StoryCollection.self)` is present in `CollectionsListView`'s `NavigationStack`.
- Created `CollectionsListView_Tests.swift` for basic test coverage (limited by SwiftUI testing constraints).
- Documented that `CollectionsListView` is not yet integrated into the main UI; the collections list is still rendered in `HomeView`.
- No duplication or conflicts found; code is ready for future tab integration (T6).

**T2: Refactor and Enhance `CollectionDetailView` (Complete)**
- Refactored state management from `@State` to `@Bindable` for better SwiftData integration.
- Removed deprecated `toggleStoryCompletion` function and button.
- Updated UI to use `Story.isCompleted` for completion status.
- Added `storyRow` helper function to resolve type-checking performance issues.
- Added `.navigationDestination(for: Story.self)` with placeholder for StoryDetailView.
- Created `CollectionDetailView_Tests.swift` with model state validation tests.
- Tests verify collection data, progress values, and state updates (UI-specific tests deferred to UI test suite).

## What's Left / Next Steps (Refined Growth Collections Plan)

-   **StoreKit Integration:** Planned and designed feature; implementation has not yet begun. This is a next priority after Growth Collections is more mature.
-   **UI Polishing:** Further refinement of UI elements, animations, and overall user experience.
-   **Error Handling:** Continue enhancing error handling for persistence operations and general app errors.
-   **Accessibility:** Thorough accessibility testing and implementation needed.
-   **CI/CD:** Review and refine CI/CD setup.
-   **Test Improvements:** Continue increasing test coverage towards target (e.g., 70%+).
