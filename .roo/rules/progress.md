# Project Progress: Magical Stories (as of 2025-04-16)

## What Works / Implemented Features

-   **Core App Structure:** Basic SwiftUI app structure with `TabView` navigation (Home, Library, Settings, Collections) is in place.
-   **Story Generation:**
    -   UI (`StoryFormView`) exists for inputting parameters.
    -   `StoryService` uses the **real Google Generative AI API** (via `GenerativeModelProtocol`) to generate story content based on parameters.
-   **Story Library:**
    -   `LibraryView` displays saved stories.
    -   Stories are persisted locally using **SwiftData** as the primary storage.
-   **Story Reading:**
    -   `StoryDetailView` displays story content, paginated using `TabView`.
    -   Page indicator and progress bar are functional.
-   **Settings:**
    -   `SettingsView` allows configuration of app settings and parental controls.
    -   `SettingsService` manages and persists these settings using **SwiftData**.
-   **Parental Controls:** Basic controls for content filtering (theme, age) and screen time (max stories per day) are implemented in `SettingsService`.
-   **Testing (Improved):**
    -   Comprehensive unit tests (using **Swift Testing**) and UI tests (using XCTest) cover key components.
    -   Successfully migrated relevant tests to the Swift Testing framework.
    -   Implemented robust mocking strategies, eliminating live API calls during unit tests.
    -   Added integration tests for critical user flows (e.g., story reading).
    -   Test coverage significantly increased.
    -   A test script (`run_tests.sh`) is available for consistent test execution.
    -   All tests passing with fixed build errors and test failures.
-   **Core Models:** Standardized core data models (`StoryModel`, `PageModel`, `StoryCollection`, `GrowthCategory`).
-   **Persistence:** Fully integrated **SwiftData** as the primary persistence layer. Legacy UserDefaults migration code and tests have been removed.
-   **Illustration Generation (Fully Implemented & Integrated):**
    *   Uses **direct REST API calls** to Google's Generative AI endpoint.
    *   Constructs **detailed prompts** with constraints.
    *   Implements **retry logic** and **comprehensive error handling**.
    *   Saves generated images to **persistent app storage**.
    *   Logs errors via `AIErrorManager`.
    *   Fully **integrated and operational**.
-   **Error Handling:**
    *   `AIErrorManager` for centralized AI error management.
    *   Enhanced error handling for AI API interactions.
    *   Graceful fallbacks for illustration failures.
    *   Comprehensive logging and user-friendly error messages.
-   **Recent Fixes:**
    *   Story creation, saving, and immediate display in LibraryView work reliably.
    *   Debugging and error visibility improved.

-   **Growth Path Collections (Feature Overview & User Flow):**
    *   **Purpose:** Themed, developmentally-focused sets of stories. Each collection targets a specific growth area (e.g., Emotional Intelligence, Problem Solving) and tracks progress as stories are read and completed. Guides children through structured content, with progress tracking and (planned) achievements.
    *   **User Flow:**
        1. **Access Collections:** User taps "Collections" tab to view all collections.
        2. **Browse Collections:** User sees a list of collection cards with progress indicators.
        3. **View Collection Details:** User taps a card to see stories and progress within the collection.
        4. **Read a Story:** User selects a story, reads it, and upon completion, progress is updated.
        5. **Track Progress:** Collection and story progress are updated and reflected in the UI.
        6. **Create New Collection:** User initiates creation, fills out the form, and a new collection with stories is generated.
        7. **Ongoing Engagement:** User continues reading, tracking progress, and earning (future) achievements.
    *   **Integration Points:**
        - Models: `StoryCollection`, `GrowthCategory`, `StoryModel` (with `readCount`, `lastReadAt`, `isCompleted`)
        - Services: `CollectionService`, `CollectionRepository`, `StoryService`
        - UI: `CollectionsListView`, `CollectionCardView`, `CollectionDetailView`, `CollectionFormView`, `StoryDetailView`
        - Persistence: SwiftData via repositories
        - Progress Tracking: Implemented and tested (story completion updates collection progress)
        - Testing: Unit and integration tests exist for core flows

## Recently Completed

**T1: Finalize `CollectionsListView` Integration (Complete)**
- Refactored `CollectionsListView` and `CollectionCardView` for clarity, accessibility, and future integration.
- Ensured `.navigationDestination(for: StoryCollection.self)` is present in `CollectionsListView`'s `NavigationStack`.
- Created `CollectionsListView_Tests.swift` for basic test coverage (limited by SwiftUI testing constraints).
- Documented that `CollectionsListView` is not yet integrated into the main UI; the collections list is still rendered in `HomeView`.
- No duplication or conflicts found; code is ready for future tab integration (T6).

**T2: Refactor and Enhance `CollectionDetailView` (Complete)**
- Refactored state management from `@State` to `@Bindable` for better SwiftData integration.
- Removed deprecated `toggleStoryCompletion` function and button.
- Updated UI to use `Story.isCompleted` for completion status.
- Added `storyRow` helper function to resolve type-checking performance issues.
- Added `.navigationDestination(for: Story.self)` with placeholder for StoryDetailView.
- Created `CollectionDetailView_Tests.swift` with model state validation tests.
- Tests verify collection data, progress values, and state updates (UI-specific tests deferred to UI test suite).

**T3: Enhance `CollectionService` Logic (Complete)**
- Implemented `generateStoriesForCollection` logic: generates multiple stories with varied themes, associates them with the collection, and persists them using the repository and `StoryService`.
- Implemented `updateCollectionProgressBasedOnReadCount`: calculates and updates collection progress based on completed stories (`isCompleted`), with robust error handling and edge case management.
- Added/verified placeholder for achievement/badge logic (`trackCollectionCompletionAchievement`).
- Comprehensive tests written/updated for all new logic, including story generation, progress calculation, marking stories as completed, and achievement tracking (placeholder).
- No duplication or conflicts found; logic is centralized and testable.

**T4: Finalize `CollectionFormView` Integration (Complete)**
- Enhanced `CollectionFormView` to use an overlay loading indicator and `.alert` for error messages, matching the pattern in `StoryFormView` for UI/UX consistency.
- Removed the inline error section in favor of alert-based error presentation.
- All controls are disabled during loading, and user feedback is clear and consistent.
- Updated `CollectionFormView_Tests.swift` with explicit TODOs for UI state tests (loading overlay, error alert, dismissal), referencing ViewInspector or UI test requirements.
- Documented the need for future UI test coverage and potential for extracting a reusable loading/error overlay component.

**T5: Progress Tracking Flow (Complete)**
- StoryDetailView now updates `readCount` and `lastReadAt` via `PersistenceService` when a story is completed.
- On completion, if the story belongs to a collection, `CollectionService.markStoryAsCompleted` is called, updating `isCompleted` and recalculating collection progress.
- UI progress bar and state update accordingly.
- Added a new integration test in `StoryReadingIntegrationTests.swift` to verify the full flow: reading a story to completion updates all relevant fields and triggers collection progress recalculation.
- All logic is centralized; no duplication or conflicts found.
- See: `App/Features/Library/StoryDetailView.swift`, `App/Services/CollectionService.swift`, `App/Services/PersistenceService.swift`, `magical-storiesTests/Views/StoryReadingIntegrationTests.swift`.
