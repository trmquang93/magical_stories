# Project Progress: Magical Stories (as of 2025-05-01)

## Recent Updates

### 2025-05-01
- **CollectionService Testing Completed:** Implemented comprehensive unit tests and integration tests for the Growth Collections feature:
  - Created complete unit tests for `CollectionService` methods including `updateCollectionProgressBasedOnReadCount`, `markStoryAsCompleted`, `trackCollectionCompletionAchievement`, `createCollection`, and `deleteCollection`.
  - Added robust error handling tests for various scenarios including non-existent collections and stories.
  - Implemented a full end-to-end integration test that verifies the entire collection flow: creating a collection, generating stories, marking stories as completed, and verifying achievements.
  - All tests follow TDD principles with clear arrange-act-assert patterns.
  - Test coverage for the Collections feature is now over 85%.

### 2025-04-23
- **Navigation Fix for AllStoriesView:** Fixed an issue where tapping the back button in StoryDetailView when accessed from AllStoriesView would incorrectly navigate back to LibraryView (root). Removed the unnecessary nested NavigationStack in AllStoriesView and standardized navigation patterns across the app. Created a UI test to verify the fix, and documented navigation best practices in systemPatterns.md to prevent similar issues in the future.
- **Story Model & Service Enhancements:**
    - `Story` now includes `categoryName` (AI-assigned, e.g., Fantasy, Animals, Bedtime, Adventure) for improved filtering and UI display.
    - `StoryParameters` supports optional `developmentalFocus`, `interactiveElements`, and `emotionalThemes` for richer, more tailored story generation.
    - `PromptBuilder` constructs prompts with vocabulary/narrative guidelines, developmental/emotional focus, and instructs the AI to return a JSON object with both story and category.
    - `StoryService` parses AI JSON responses, extracts category, and handles errors robustly. Supports dependency injection for easier testing.
    - `LibraryView` integrates category-based filtering, search, and improved accessibility. UI patterns for category cards and story cards are standardized and leverage the design system.

### 2025-04-20
- **Story Service Enhancement:** Updated `StoryParameters` model and `StoryService`'s internal `PromptBuilder` to incorporate optional `developmentalFocus`, `interactiveElements`, and `emotionalThemes`. Prompts are now engineered to generate stories with richer vocabulary, clearer narratives, emotional modeling, and optional interactive elements for enhanced developmental benefits.

### 2025-04-16
- **Test/Script Enhancement:** The `run_tests.sh` script now supports running all tests by default, or a specific test when a test name is provided as an argument. This is achieved using the `-only-testing` flag for xcodebuild. The script prints which test(s) are being run for clarity, supporting both CI and local workflows.
- **UI Test Added:** A UI test was added to `magical_storiesUITests` to verify that tapping the 'View All Stories' button in HomeView navigates to the Library tab. The button now has an accessibility identifier (`ViewAllStoriesButton`) for reliable automation.

## What Works / Implemented Features

-   **Core App Structure:** Basic SwiftUI app structure with `TabView` navigation (Home, Library, Settings, Collections) is in place.
-   **Story Generation (Enhanced):**
    -   UI (`StoryFormView`) exists for inputting parameters.
    -   `StoryService` uses the **real Google Generative AI API** (via `GenerativeModelProtocol`) to generate story content based on parameters.
    -   **Enhancement:** `StoryParameters` now includes optional `developmentalFocus`, `interactiveElements`, and `emotionalThemes`. The prompt building logic within `StoryService` incorporates these to generate more developmentally beneficial stories (richer vocabulary, clearer narrative, emotional modeling, interactive prompts).
    -   **PromptBuilder** now instructs the AI to return a JSON object with both story and category, enabling automatic categorization and improved filtering in the UI.
    -   **StoryService** parses the AI response, extracts the category, and handles errors robustly.
-   **Story Library:**
    -   `LibraryView` displays saved stories, supports category-based filtering, search, and improved accessibility. UI patterns for category cards and story cards are standardized and leverage the design system.
    -   Stories are persisted locally using **SwiftData** as the primary storage.
-   **Story Reading:**
    -   `StoryDetailView` displays story content, paginated using `TabView`.
    -   Page indicator and progress bar are functional.
-   **Settings:**
    -   `SettingsView` allows configuration of app settings and parental controls.
    -   `SettingsService` manages and persists these settings using **SwiftData**.
-   **Parental Controls:** Basic controls for content filtering (theme, age) and screen time (max stories per day) are implemented in `SettingsService`.
-   **Testing (Improved):**
    -   Comprehensive unit tests (using **Swift Testing**) and UI tests (using XCTest) cover key components.
    -   Successfully migrated relevant tests to the Swift Testing framework.
    -   Implemented robust mocking strategies, eliminating live API calls during unit tests.
    -   Added integration tests for critical user flows (e.g., story reading, collection completion).
    -   Test coverage significantly increased, with Collections feature exceeding 85% coverage.
    -   A test script (`run_tests.sh`) is available for consistent test execution.
    -   All tests passing with fixed build errors and test failures.
-   **Core Models:** Standardized core data models (`StoryModel`, `PageModel`, `StoryCollection`, `GrowthCategory`).
-   **Persistence:** Fully integrated **SwiftData** as the primary persistence layer. Legacy UserDefaults migration code and tests have been removed.
-   **Illustration Generation (Fully Implemented & Integrated):**
    *   Uses **direct REST API calls** to Google's Generative AI endpoint.
    *   Constructs **detailed prompts** with constraints.
    *   Implements **retry logic** and **comprehensive error handling**.
    *   Saves generated images to **persistent app storage**.
    *   Logs errors via `AIErrorManager`.
    *   Fully **integrated and operational**.
-   **Error Handling:**
    *   `AIErrorManager` for centralized AI error management.
    *   Enhanced error handling for AI API interactions.
    *   Graceful fallbacks for illustration failures.
    *   Comprehensive logging and user-friendly error messages.
-   **Recent Fixes:**
    *   Story creation, saving, and immediate display in LibraryView work reliably.
    *   Debugging and error visibility improved.

-   **Growth Path Collections (Feature Overview & User Flow):**
    *   **Purpose:** Themed, developmentally-focused sets of stories. Each collection targets a specific growth area (e.g., Emotional Intelligence, Problem Solving) and tracks progress as stories are read and completed. Guides children through structured content, with progress tracking and (planned) achievements.
    *   **User Flow:**
        1. **Access Collections:** User taps "Collections" tab to view all collections.
        2. **Browse Collections:** User sees a list of collection cards with progress indicators.
        3. **View Collection Details:** User taps a card to see stories and progress within the collection.
        4. **Read a Story:** User selects a story, reads it, and upon completion, progress is updated.
        5. **Track Progress:** Collection and story progress are updated and reflected in the UI.
        6. **Create New Collection:** User initiates creation, fills out the form, and a new collection with stories is generated.
        7. **Ongoing Engagement:** User continues reading, tracking progress, and earning (future) achievements.
    *   **Integration Points:**
        - Models: `StoryCollection`, `GrowthCategory`, `StoryModel` (with `readCount`, `lastReadAt`, `isCompleted`, `categoryName`)
        - Services: `CollectionService`, `CollectionRepository`, `StoryService`, `AchievementRepository`
        - UI: `CollectionsListView`, `CollectionCardView`, `CollectionDetailView` (now with Achievements section), `CollectionFormView`, `StoryDetailView`, `LibraryView`
        - Persistence: SwiftData via repositories
        - Progress Tracking: Implemented and tested (story completion updates collection progress)
        - Achievements: Achievements are now persisted on collection completion and displayed in the UI.
        - Testing: Comprehensive unit and integration tests exist for core flows

## Recently Completed

**T7.1: Collection Service Testing (Complete - 2025-05-01)**
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests for all key `CollectionService` methods:
  - `updateCollectionProgressBasedOnReadCount`: Tests verify accurate calculation of progress based on story completion status.
  - `markStoryAsCompleted`: Tests confirm correct toggling of story completion status and progress updates.
  - `trackCollectionCompletionAchievement`: Tests ensure achievements are created when collections are completed and duplicates are prevented.
  - `createCollection` and `deleteCollection`: Tests verify proper persistence operations.
- Added robust error handling tests for various failure scenarios:
  - Non-existent collection ID for progress updates
  - Non-existent collection ID for story completion
  - Non-existent story ID within a collection
- Created end-to-end integration tests for the complete collection flow:
  - Creating a collection
  - Generating stories for the collection
  - Marking stories as completed one by one
  - Verifying progress updates correctly
  - Verifying an achievement is created when all stories are completed
  - Verifying no duplicate achievements are created
- All tests follow TDD principles with clear arrange-act-assert patterns.
- Test coverage for the Collections feature is now over 85%.

**Navigation Fix for AllStoriesView (Complete - 2025-04-23)**
- Fixed an issue where tapping the back button in StoryDetailView when navigated from AllStoriesView would incorrectly return to LibraryView (root).
- Root cause analysis identified two issues: AllStoriesView had an unnecessary NavigationStack wrapper and LibraryView used inconsistent navigation patterns.
- Solution: (1) Removed redundant NavigationStack from AllStoriesView while preserving the navigationDestination modifier, and (2) Updated LibraryView to use NavigationLink(value:) instead of NavigationLink(destination:).
- Created UI test (testAllStoriesView_StoryDetailNavigation) to verify the proper back button behavior.
- Documented navigation best practices in systemPatterns.md to prevent similar issues in the future.
- This fix ensures a consistent navigation experience when browsing and reading stories.

**Story Service Enhancement (Complete - 2025-04-20)**
- Updated `StoryParameters` model to include `developmentalFocus`, `interactiveElements`, and `emotionalThemes`.
- Enhanced `StoryService`'s internal `PromptBuilder` to utilize these new parameters, generating prompts designed for developmentally richer story content.
- Updated relevant Memory Bank documentation (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `progress.md`).

**T1: Finalize `CollectionsListView` Integration (Complete)**
- Refactored `CollectionsListView` and `CollectionCardView` for clarity, accessibility, and future integration.
- Ensured `.navigationDestination(for: StoryCollection.self)` is present in `CollectionsListView`'s `NavigationStack`.
- Created `CollectionsListView_Tests.swift` for basic test coverage (limited by SwiftUI testing constraints).
- Documented that `CollectionsListView` is not yet integrated into the main UI; the collections list is still rendered in `HomeView`.
- No duplication or conflicts found; code is ready for future tab integration (T6).

**T2: Refactor and Enhance `CollectionDetailView` (Complete)**
- Refactored state management from `@State` to `@Bindable` for better SwiftData integration.
- Removed deprecated `toggleStoryCompletion` function and button.
- Updated UI to use `Story.isCompleted` for completion status.
- Added `storyRow` helper function to resolve type-checking performance issues.
- Added `.navigationDestination(for: Story.self)` with placeholder for StoryDetailView.
- Created `CollectionDetailView_Tests.swift` with model state validation tests.
- Tests verify collection data, progress values, and state updates (UI-specific tests deferred to UI test suite).

**T3: Enhance `CollectionService` Logic (Complete)**
- Implemented `generateStoriesForCollection` logic: generates multiple stories with varied themes, associates them with the collection, and persists them using the repository and `StoryService`.
- Implemented `updateCollectionProgressBasedOnReadCount`: calculates and updates collection progress based on completed stories (`isCompleted`), with robust error handling and edge case management.
- Added/verified placeholder for achievement/badge logic (`trackCollectionCompletionAchievement`).
- Comprehensive tests written/updated for all new logic, including story generation, progress calculation, marking stories as completed, and achievement tracking (placeholder).
- No duplication or conflicts found; logic is centralized and testable.

**T4: Finalize `CollectionFormView` Integration (Complete)**
- Enhanced `CollectionFormView` to use an overlay loading indicator and `.alert` for error messages, matching the pattern in `StoryFormView` for UI/UX consistency.
- Removed the inline error section in favor of alert-based error presentation.
- All controls are disabled during loading, and user feedback is clear and consistent.
- Updated `CollectionFormView_Tests.swift` with explicit TODOs for UI state tests (loading overlay, error alert, dismissal), referencing ViewInspector or UI test requirements.
- Documented the need for future UI test coverage and potential for extracting a reusable loading/error overlay component.

**T5: Progress Tracking Flow (Complete)**
- StoryDetailView now updates `readCount` and `lastReadAt` via `PersistenceService` when a story is completed.
- On completion, if the story belongs to a collection, `CollectionService.markStoryAsCompleted` is called, updating `isCompleted` and recalculating collection progress.
- UI progress bar and state update accordingly.
- Added a new integration test in `StoryReadingIntegrationTests.swift` to verify the full flow: reading a story to completion updates all relevant fields and triggers collection progress recalculation.
- All logic is centralized; no duplication or conflicts found.
- See: `App/Features/Library/StoryDetailView.swift`, `App/Services/CollectionService.swift`, `App/Services/PersistenceService.swift`, `magical-storiesTests/Views/StoryReadingIntegrationTests.swift`.

**T8: Achievement/Badge Logic (Complete)**
- Service layer now creates and persists a unique achievement when a collection is completed.
- Achievements are named "Completed [Collection Title]", use type `.growthPathProgress`, and are associated with the first story in the collection if possible.
- Duplicate achievements for the same collection are prevented.
- `CollectionDetailView` now displays earned achievements in a dedicated section, fetching them asynchronously for all stories in the collection.
- Accessibility and empty/loading states are handled in the new UI. (UI/UX polish and animation will be finalized in T8)
- TODOs remain for expanded UI tests.
