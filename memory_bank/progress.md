# Project Progress: Magical Stories (as of 2025-04-06)

## What Works / Implemented Features

-   **Core App Structure:** Basic SwiftUI app structure with `TabView` navigation (Home, Library, Settings) is in place.
-   **Story Generation:**
    -   UI (`StoryFormView`) exists for inputting parameters.
    -   `StoryService` uses the **real Google Generative AI API** (via `GenerativeModelProtocol`) to generate story content based on parameters.
-   **Story Library:**
    -   `LibraryView` displays saved stories.
    -   Stories are persisted locally using `UserDefaults` (MVP) via `PersistenceService`.
-   **Story Reading:**
    -   `StoryDetailView` displays story content, paginated using `TabView`.
    -   Page indicator and progress bar are functional.
-   **Settings:**
    -   `SettingsView` allows configuration of app settings and parental controls.
    -   `SettingsService` manages and persists these settings using `UserDefaults`.
-   **Parental Controls:** Basic controls for content filtering (theme, age) and screen time (max stories per day) are implemented in `SettingsService`.
-   **Testing:** Unit tests (using Swift Testing) and UI tests (using XCTest) exist for various components. A test script (`run_tests.sh`) is available. Build errors and test failures resolved; all tests passing.
-   **Core Models:** Standardized core data models (`Story`, `StoryParameters`).
-   **Persistence:** Integrated `PersistenceService` (`UserDefaults`) into `StoryService`. Verified handling of updated `Story` model with `Page` array and `illustrationURL`.
-   **Illustration Generation:**
    *   Refactored `StoryModels` to include a `Codable Page` struct and updated `Story` to hold `[Page]`.
    *   Implemented `IllustrationService` and **replaced the mock** with real Google AI SDK calls (using `GoogleGenerativeAI` SDK, assuming image support).
    *   Integrated real `IllustrationService` into `StoryProcessor`. API key handling via `AppConfig.swift` / `Config.plist`.
    *   Verified `PageView` correctly displays images/placeholders using `AsyncImage`.
    *   Updated unit tests (`IllustrationServiceTests`, `StoryProcessorTests`, etc.) to use XCTest and handle the real service integration.
    *   **Verified API key configuration** (`GeminiAPIKey`) and correct image generation model name in `IllustrationService`.
    *   **Implemented comprehensive unit testing** with network mocking to avoid hitting the live API.
    *   **Created a command-line testing tool** (`IllustrationServiceTester.swift`) for manual integration testing.
    *   Confirmed and adjusted response parsing logic in `IllustrationService` based on actual SDK behavior.
    *   Completed end-to-end integration testing with a valid API key.

## What's Left / Next Steps

-   **Growth Story Collections:** UI (`GrowthStoryFormView`) might exist, but the logic for generating themed collections based on developmental goals needs implementation.
-   **StoreKit Integration:** Configured but likely not fully implemented for premium features or subscriptions.
-   **UI Polishing:** Further refinement of UI elements, animations, and overall user experience, including illustration display.
-   **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling, particularly for AI API interactions (text and image generation) and persistence.
-   **Accessibility:** Thorough accessibility testing and implementation needed, especially for dynamic content like illustrations.
-   **CI/CD:** Basic configuration mentioned, may need further setup and refinement.
-   **Persistence Migration:** Consider migrating from `UserDefaults` to SwiftData for `Story` persistence as planned.
