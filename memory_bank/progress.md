# Project Progress: Magical Stories (as of 2025-04-08)

## What Works / Implemented Features

-   **Core App Structure:** Basic SwiftUI app structure with `TabView` navigation (Home, Library, Settings) is in place.
-   **Story Generation:**
    -   UI (`StoryFormView`) exists for inputting parameters.
    -   `StoryService` uses the **real Google Generative AI API** (via `GenerativeModelProtocol`) to generate story content based on parameters.
-   **Story Library:**
    -   `LibraryView` displays saved stories.
    -   Stories are persisted locally using `UserDefaults` (MVP) via `PersistenceService`.
-   **Story Reading:**
    -   `StoryDetailView` displays story content, paginated using `TabView`.
    -   Page indicator and progress bar are functional.
-   **Settings:**
    -   `SettingsView` allows configuration of app settings and parental controls.
    -   `SettingsService` manages and persists these settings using `UserDefaults`.
-   **Parental Controls:** Basic controls for content filtering (theme, age) and screen time (max stories per day) are implemented in `SettingsService`.
-   **Testing:** Unit tests (using Swift Testing) and UI tests (using XCTest) exist for various components. A test script (`run_tests.sh`) is available. Build errors and test failures resolved; all tests passing.
-   **Core Models:** Standardized core data models (`Story`, `StoryParameters`).
-   **Persistence:** Integrated `PersistenceService` (`UserDefaults`) into `StoryService`. Verified handling of updated `Story` model with `Page` array.
-   **Illustration Generation (Updated):**
    *   `Page` model now stores **relative path** (`illustrationRelativePath`) and **status** (`illustrationStatus`) instead of absolute URLs.
    *   `IllustrationService` saves images in **persistent app directory** (`Application Support/Illustrations`), not temp.
    *   Only **relative paths** are stored, enabling dynamic URL reconstruction.
    *   **Retry logic**: Up to 5 attempts with 1-second delay on failures.
    *   If all retries fail, page status is `.failed`.
    *   **Manual regeneration**: UI shows a regenerate button on failure, allowing user-triggered retries.
    *   `StoryProcessor` updated to handle new model and retry logic.
    *   `PageView` updated to display images based on relative path and status, with regenerate button.
    *   Protocols and mocks updated accordingly.
    *   All related tests updated and passing.
-   **Error Handling:**
    *   Created AIErrorManager for centralized error management.
    *   Enhanced error handling for AI API interactions (text and image generation).
    *   Implemented graceful fallbacks with placeholder images for illustration failures.
    *   Added comprehensive logging and user-friendly error messages.

## What's Left / Next Steps

-   **Growth Story Collections:** UI (`GrowthStoryFormView`) might exist, but the logic for generating themed collections based on developmental goals needs implementation.
-   **StoreKit Integration:** Configured but likely not fully implemented for premium features or subscriptions.
-   **UI Polishing:** Further refinement of UI elements, animations, and overall user experience, including illustration display.
-   **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling for persistence operations and general app errors (excluding AI interactions which are now handled).
-   **Accessibility:** Thorough accessibility testing and implementation needed, especially for dynamic content like illustrations.
-   **CI/CD:** Basic configuration mentioned, may need further setup and refinement.
-   **Persistence Migration:** Consider migrating from `UserDefaults` to SwiftData for `Story` persistence as planned.
