# Active Context (as of 2025-04-08)

## Current Focus
The primary focus is on **finalizing designs and preparing for implementation** of the next major features, which are **planned and designed but not yet started**:
1.  **Growth Collections:** Planned feature to add themed story collections; implementation has not yet begun.
2.  **StoreKit Integration:** Planned monetization strategy; implementation has not yet begun.
3.  **Persistence Migration:** Planned migration from `UserDefaults` to `SwiftData`; implementation has not yet begun.

## Recent Changes (Completion & Verification)

*   **Google AI Integration Verified:**
    *   Confirmed correct API key (`GeminiAPIKey`) usage.
    *   Verified the image generation model (`gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation`).
    *   Validated response parsing logic for the Gemini Flash API (handling `inlineData` base64 images).
*   **IllustrationService Implementation Completed:**
    *   Now primarily uses **direct REST API calls** to Google's Generative AI endpoint for image generation.
    *   Constructs **detailed prompts** emphasizing whimsical, child-friendly illustrations, explicitly instructing **not to depict anthropomorphic animals**.
    *   Implements **retry logic** with up to 5 attempts and 1-second delays between failures.
    *   Handles errors comprehensively via the `IllustrationError` enum.
    *   Successfully **saves generated images** to persistent storage at `Application Support/Illustrations/`.
    *   Logs errors through the `AIErrorManager`.
    *   Fully **integrated and operational** within the app's story generation flow.
    *   The SDK import remains, but the primary integration is now via REST API calls.
*   **Testing Strategy Implemented:**
    *   Successfully implemented improved mocking strategies (avoiding live API calls in unit tests).
    *   Migrated relevant tests to use Swift Testing framework.
    *   Increased overall test coverage, including integration tests.
*   **Design Phase Completed:**
    *   Finalized architectural designs for Growth Collections, StoreKit integration, and SwiftData persistence migration.
*   **Story Saving & UI Refresh Fixes:**
    *   Fixed async timing and UI refresh bug in story saving flow.
    *   Implemented debug logging and error handling in `StoryService`.
    *   Stories now appear immediately after creation in LibraryView.

## Next Steps
1.  **Growth Collections:** Planned implementation of models and `CollectionService`.
2.  **StoreKit Integration:** Planned implementation of `PurchaseService`, `EntitlementManager`, and related UI.
3.  **SwiftData Migration:** Planned schema definition and initial integration.
4.  **UI/UX Refinement:** Upcoming focus on refining the story reading interface and overall user experience.
5.  **Accessibility Improvements:** Upcoming focus on enhancing accessibility features.
